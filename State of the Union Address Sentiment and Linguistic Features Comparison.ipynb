       "[u'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\\n\\nLess than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.\\n\\nEach day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission -- to make America great again for all Americans. (Applause.)\\n\\nOver the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America\\'s soul, and the steel in America\\'s spine.\\n\\nEach test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.\\n\\nWe saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane.\\n\\nWe saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\\n\\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. (Applause.) Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) \\n\\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He\\'s here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires.\\n\\nTo everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands -- everywhere -- we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. (Applause.) \\n\\nThank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very much, David. Great job. \\n\\nSome trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. (Applause.) I think they like you, Steve. (Laughter.) \\n\\nWe are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath -- (applause) -- yes. Yes.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve. (Applause.) \\n\\nOver the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there\\'s a challenge, we tame it. If there\\'s an opportunity, we seize it.\\n\\nSo let\\'s begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. (Applause.) And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.\\n\\nSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including -- (applause) -- including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. (Applause.) After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. (Applause.) \\n\\nUnemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. (Applause.) It\\'s something I\\'m very proud of. African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. (Applause.) And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. (Applause.) \\n\\nSmall-business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion, and more, in value in just this short period of time. The great news -- (applause) -- the great news for Americans\\' 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.\\n\\nAnd just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. (Applause.) \\n\\nOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. (Applause.) Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. (Applause.) We also doubled the child tax credit. (Applause.) A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. (Applause.) \\n\\nIn April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system, and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month -- a lot more. (Applause.) \\n\\nWe eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn\\'t afford government-ordered health plans. (Applause.) We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone. Thank heaven. (Applause.) \\n\\nWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. (Applause.) These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money. (Applause.) \\n\\nSmall businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.\\n\\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They\\'ve just finished the best year in their 20-year history. (Applause.) Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. Good feeling. (Applause.) \\n\\nOne of Staub\\'s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax?cut raise into his new home and his two daughters\\' education. Corey, please stand. (Applause.) And he\\'s a great welder. (Laughter.) I was told that by the man that owns that company that\\'s doing so well. So congratulations, Corey. \\n\\nSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it\\'s getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. (Applause.) And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States, just a little while ago. (Applause.) \\n\\nThis, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.\\n\\nSo to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you\\'ve been, or where you\\'ve come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything. (Applause.) \\n\\nTonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything.\\n\\nWe all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. (Applause.) \\n\\nTogether, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is, \"In God We Trust.\" (Applause.) \\n\\nAnd we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. (Applause.)\\n\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans\\' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. (Applause.) Preston, a job well done. (Applause.) \\n\\nYoung patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special -- that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all you\\'ve done, Preston. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\\n\\nPreston\\'s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the National Anthem. (Applause.)\\n\\nAmericans love their country, and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government.\\n\\nWorking with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe are totally defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. (Applause.) Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. (Applause.) Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. (Applause.) \\n\\nAnd I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey. (Applause.) \\n\\nAll Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that\\'s what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. (Applause.) \\n\\nSo, tonight, I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people. (Applause.)\\n\\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal. (Applause.) We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world. (Applause.) \\n\\nIn Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America\\'s great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again. And that\\'s what\\'s happening. (Applause.) Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States -- something we haven\\'t seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama -- a big one. And we haven\\'t seen this in a long time. It\\'s all coming back. (Applause.)\\n\\nVery soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country. This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They\\'re coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. That\\'s where they want to be. (Applause.)\\n\\nExciting progress is happening every single day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country\\'s history. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe also believe that patients with terminal conditions, and terminal illness, should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives.\\n\\nPeople who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It\\'s time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. (Applause.)\\n\\nOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. (Applause.) In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it\\'s very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. (Applause.) And prices will come down substantially. Watch.\\n\\nAmerica has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our nation has lost its wealth, but we\\'re getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they\\'ll be good ones, but they\\'ll be fair. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. (Applause.)\\n\\nAmerica is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn\\'t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? (Applause.) I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve. (Applause.)\\n\\nTonight, I\\'m calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it. (Applause.)\\n\\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage. (Applause.) \\n\\nWe will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart, and American hands, and American grit. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe want every American to know the dignity of a hard day\\'s work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let\\'s invest in workforce development and let\\'s invest in job training, which we need so badly. (Applause.) Let\\'s open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. (Applause.) And let\\'s support working families by supporting paid family leave. (Applause.) \\n\\nAs America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance at life. (Applause.) \\n\\nStruggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.\\n\\nFor decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They\\'ve allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. \\n\\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa\\'s 16th Birthday -- such a happy time it should have been -- neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. \\n\\nSix members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa\\'s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa\\'s high school. \\n\\nEvelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand. Thank you very much. (Applause.) I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you. (Applause.)\\n\\nWhile we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain.\\n\\nTonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents -- these are great people; these are great, great people -- that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again. (Applause.) \\n\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America\\'s children, America\\'s struggling workers, and America\\'s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.\\n\\nSo, tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. (Applause.) My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. (Applause.)\\n\\nHere tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \"DJ\" and \"CJ.\" He said, \"Call me either one.\" So we\\'ll call you \"CJ.\" Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. Tough job. \\n\\nAt one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ\\'s murder. And they wanted it to happen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang members.\\n\\nAnd I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done -- we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons. \\n\\nSo I just want to congratulate you, CJ. You\\'re a brave guy. Thank you very much. (Applause.) \\n\\nAnd I asked CJ, \"What\\'s the secret?\" He said, \"We\\'re just tougher than they are.\" And I like that answer. (Laughter and applause.) Now let\\'s get Congress to send you -- and all of the people in this great chamber have to do it; we have no choice. CJ, we\\'re going to send you reinforcements, and we\\'re going to send them to you quickly. It\\'s what you need. (Applause.) \\n\\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have. (Applause.) \\n\\nHere are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered. (Applause.) Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period. (Applause.)\\n\\nThe second pillar fully secures the border. (Applause.) That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like CJ, to keep our communities safe. (Applause.) Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release. (Applause.)\\n\\nThe third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people. (Applause.) It\\'s time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. (Applause.)\\n\\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. (Applause.) Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. (Applause.) This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford. (Applause.) \\n\\nIt\\'s time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. (Applause.)\\n\\nThese four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.\\n\\nFor over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\\n\\nMost importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first. (Applause.) So let\\'s come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. (Applause.)\\n\\nThese reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses -- 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. (Applause.)\\n\\nMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. The struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do -- in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He\\'s here tonight with his wife Rebecca. (Applause.) Thank you, Ryan. \\n\\nLast year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn\\'t know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\\n\\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \"You will do it, because you can.\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our nation. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca.\\n\\nAs we rebuild America\\'s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.\\n\\nAround the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.\\n\\nFor this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else. (Applause.) \\n\\nPerhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly. \\n\\nLast year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations, as well. (Applause.) But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.\\n\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon, and hopefully safely. \\n\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport, and maintained artificial respiration through two and a half hours and through emergency surgery.\\n\\nKenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin\\'s selfless love for his fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \"V\" for \"valor.\" Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you. (Applause.)\\n\\nTerrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. (Applause.) And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. \\n\\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released.\\n\\nSo today, I\\'m keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis, who is doing a great job, thank you -- (applause) -- to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.)\\n\\nI am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.)\\n\\nAt the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement. (Applause.)\\n\\nAlong with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans. (Applause.) \\n\\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate just months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. (Applause.) \\n\\nShortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America\\'s sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid.\\n\\nThat is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America. (Applause.) \\n\\nAs we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.\\n\\nWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. (Applause.) \\n\\nI am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.\\n\\nMy administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. (Applause.) \\n\\nBut no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. North Korea\\'s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.\\n\\nPast experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.\\n\\nWe need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.\\n\\nOtto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia -- and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.\\n\\nOtto\\'s wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto\\'s brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please. (Applause.) Incredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)\\n\\nTonight, we pledge to honor Otto\\'s memory with total American resolve. Thank you. (Applause.) \\n\\nFinally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.\\n\\nIn 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth. \\n\\nLater, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he\\'d met any Christians. He had -- and he resolved, after that, to be free. \\n\\nSeong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.\\n\\nToday he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth.\\n\\nToday, he has a new leg. But, Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you\\'ve come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you. (Applause.) Seong-ho\\'s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.\\n\\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world.\\n\\nThat is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.\\n\\nAtop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought, and lived, and died to protect her. Monuments to Washington, and Jefferson, and Lincoln, and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia.\\n\\nAnd freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol -- this living monument -- this is the moment to the American people. (Applause.)\\n\\nAUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT: We\\'re a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.\\n\\nThey work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, and police officers, and border agents, medics, and Marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, this nation, belongs entirely to them. (Applause.)\\n\\nOur task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.\\n\\nAmericans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it\\'s the people who are making America great again. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail.\\n\\nOur families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.\\n\\nThank you. And God bless America. Goodnight. (Applause.)',\n",
       " u'Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year that I\\'ve come here to report on the State of the Union. And for this final one, I\\'m going to try to make it a little shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa. [Laughter] I\\'ve been there. I\\'ll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips. [Laughter]\\n\\nNow, I understand that because it\\'s an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low. But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. So, who knows, we might surprise the cynics again. \\n\\nBut tonight I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ve got plenty&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration system, protecting our kids from gun violence, equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hard-working families. They\\'re still the right thing to do. And I won\\'t let up until they get done. \\n\\nBut for my final address to this Chamber, I don\\'t want to just talk about next year. I want to focus on the next 5 years, the next 10 years, and beyond. I want to focus on our future. \\n\\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change, change that\\'s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. It\\'s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises this education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It\\'s change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate. \\n\\nAmerica has been through big changes before: wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change; who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the \"dogmas of the quiet past.\" Instead, we thought anew and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America\\'s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did, because we saw opportunity with a&mdash;where others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before. \\n\\nWhat was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation&mdash;our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law&mdash;these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come. \\n\\nIn fact, it\\'s in that spirit that we have made progress these past 7 years. That\\'s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. That\\'s how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector. That\\'s how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans. That\\'s how we secured the freedom in every State to marry the person we love. \\n\\nBut such progress is not inevitable. It\\'s the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, in the incredible things that we can do together? \\n\\nSo let\\'s talk about the future and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next President is or who controls the next Congress. First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? Second, how do we make technology work for us and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman? And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what\\'s best in us and not what\\'s worst? \\n\\nLet me start with the economy and a basic fact: The United States of America right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We\\'re in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history. More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest 2 years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. That\\'s just part of a manufacturing surge that\\'s created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past 6 years. And we\\'ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters. \\n\\nAnyone claiming that America\\'s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Now, what is true&mdash;and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious&mdash;is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the great recession hit, changes that have not let up. \\n\\nToday, technology doesn\\'t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top. \\n\\nAll these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing. It\\'s made it harder for a hard-working family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot. \\n\\nFor the past 7 years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody. We\\'ve made progress, but we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that we\\'ve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree. \\n\\nWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we\\'ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing pre-K for all and offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids. \\n\\nAnd we have to make college affordable for every American. No hard-working student should be stuck in the red. We\\'ve already reduced student loan payments by&mdash;to 10 percent of a borrower\\'s income. And that\\'s good. But now we\\'ve actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing 2 years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I\\'m going to keep fighting to get that started this year. It\\'s the right thing to do. \\n\\nBut a great education isn\\'t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. It\\'s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this Chamber. [Laughter] For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool, they may have to retrain. But they shouldn\\'t lose what they\\'ve already worked so hard to build in the process. \\n\\nThat\\'s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever. We shouldn\\'t weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It\\'s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business, you\\'ll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far. And in the process, health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law. \\n\\nNow, I\\'m guessing we won\\'t agree on health care anytime soon, but&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;a little applause back there. [Laughter] Just a guess. But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security. Say a hard-working American loses his job. We shouldn\\'t just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance, we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that\\'s ready to hire him. If that new job doesn\\'t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he\\'s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That\\'s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody. \\n\\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up. And I\\'d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don\\'t have children. \\n\\nBut there are some areas where&mdash;we just have to be honest&mdash;it has been difficult to find agreement over the last 7 years. And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the Government should play in making sure the system\\'s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And it\\'s an honest disagreement, and the American people have a choice to make. \\n\\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is redtape that needs to be cut. [Applause] There you go! Yes! See? But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won\\'t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else\\'s expense. Middle class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren\\'t the principal reason wages haven\\'t gone up; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It\\'s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts. [Laughter] \\n\\nThe point is, I believe that in this new economy, workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And I\\'m not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses who have figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders. And I want to spread those best practices across America. That\\'s part of a brighter future. \\n\\nIn fact, it turns, out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges? \\n\\nSixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn\\'t deny Sputnik was up there. [Laughter] We didn\\'t argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight. And 12 years later, we were walking on the Moon. \\n\\nNow, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better future. That\\'s who we are. \\n\\nAnd over the past 7 years, we\\'ve nurtured that spirit. We\\'ve protected an open Internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. We\\'ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more. \\n\\nLast year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they\\'ve had in over a decade. Well&mdash;so tonight I\\'m announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he\\'s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I\\'m putting Joe in charge of mission control. For the loved ones we\\'ve all lost, for the families that we can still save, let\\'s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. What do you say, Joe? Let\\'s make it happen. \\n\\nNow, medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. [Laughter] You will be pretty lonely, because you\\'ll be debating our military, most of America\\'s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it\\'s a problem and intend to solve it. But even if the planet wasn\\'t at stake, even if 2014 wasn\\'t the warmest year on record&mdash;until 2015 turned out to be even hotter&mdash;why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future? Listen, 7 years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal in jobs that pay better than average. We\\'re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy, something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, we\\'ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth. Gas under 2 bucks a gallon ain\\'t bad either. [Laughter] \\n\\nNow we\\'ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don\\'t show them where the trends are going. And that\\'s why I\\'m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st-century transportation system. \\n\\nNow, none of this is going to happen overnight. And yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we\\'ll create, the money we\\'ll save, the planet we\\'ll preserve&mdash;that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve. And it\\'s within our grasp. \\n\\nNow, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that\\'s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there\\'s a problem. \\n\\nNow, I told you earlier all the talk of America\\'s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period. [Applause] Period. It\\'s not even close. [Applause] It\\'s not even close. It\\'s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. [Applause] All right. No nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that\\'s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead. They call us. So I think it\\'s useful to level set here, because when we don\\'t, we don\\'t make good decisions. \\n\\nNow, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that\\'s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and it\\'s certainly not because of diminished American strength. In today\\'s world, we\\'re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. \\n\\nThe Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria, client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality. It\\'s up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system. And to do that well, it means that we\\'ve got to set priorities. Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today\\'s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country. Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out. \\n\\nBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is world war III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages, they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That is the story ISIL wants to tell. That\\'s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don\\'t need to build them up to show that we\\'re serious, and we sure don\\'t need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world\\'s largest religions. We just need to call them what they are: killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s exactly what we\\'re doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL\\'s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 airstrikes, we\\'re taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. We\\'re training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria. \\n\\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote. [Applause] Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America\\'s commitment&mdash;or mine&mdash;to see that justice is done, just ask Usama bin Laden. Ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits. \\n\\nOur foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it can\\'t stop there. For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world: in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America, in Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn\\'t pass muster on the world stage. \\n\\nWe also can\\'t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it\\'s done with the best of intentions. That\\'s not leadership; that\\'s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. It\\'s the lesson of Vietnam; it\\'s the lesson of Iraq. And we should have learned it by now. \\n\\nNow, fortunately there is a smarter approach: a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies, but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight. That\\'s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we\\'re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace. That\\'s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war. \\n\\nThat\\'s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, our development workers&mdash;they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million, lives were saved. \\n\\nThat\\'s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it. It\\'s the right thing to do. \\n\\nLet me give you another example. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy. It set us back in Latin America. That\\'s why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the cold war is over. Lift the embargo. \\n\\nThe point is, American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world&mdash;except when we kill terrorists&mdash;or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity. \\n\\nWhen we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, it\\'s the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now we\\'re on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. That\\'s within our grasp. And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something I\\'ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year. \\n\\nThat\\'s American strength. That\\'s American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That\\'s why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. There\\'s a better way. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why we need to reject any politics&mdash;any politics&mdash;that targets people because of race or religion. Let me just say this. This is not a matter of political correctness, this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. \\n\\nHis Holiness Pope Francis told this body from the very spot that I\\'m standing on tonight that \"to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\" When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names, that doesn\\'t make us safer. That\\'s not telling it what&mdash;telling it like it is. It\\'s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country. \"We the People.\" Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we\\'ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, that that\\'s how we might perfect our Union. And that brings me to the fourth and maybe most important thing that I want to say tonight. \\n\\nThe future we want&mdash;all of us want&mdash;opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids&mdash;all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics. \\n\\nA better politics doesn\\'t mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country: different regions, different attitudes, different interests. That\\'s one of our strengths too. Our Founders distributed power between States and branches of government and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security. \\n\\nBut democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn\\'t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice. It doesn\\'t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn\\'t matter, that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest. \\n\\nToo many Americans feel that way right now. It\\'s one of the few regrets of my Presidency: that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt, a President with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee, I\\'ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office. \\n\\nBut, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task&mdash;or any President\\'s&mdash;alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this Chamber, good people, who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know; you\\'ve told me. It\\'s the worst kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you aren\\'t enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor. \\n\\nBut that means if we want a better politics&mdash;and I\\'m addressing the American people now&mdash;if we want a better politics, it\\'s not enough just to change a Congressman or change a Senator or even change a President. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves. \\n\\nI think we\\'ve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around. Let a bipartisan group do it. \\n\\nI believe we\\'ve got to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests can\\'t bankroll our elections. And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can\\'t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution. Because it\\'s a problem. And most of you don\\'t like raising money. [Laughter] I know. I\\'ve done it. \\n\\nWe\\'ve got to make it easier to vote, not harder. We need to modernize it for the way we live now. This is America: We want to make it easier for people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that. But I can\\'t do these things on my own. Changes in our political process&mdash;in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected&mdash;that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That\\'s what\\'s meant by a government of, by, and for the people. \\n\\nWhat I\\'m suggesting is hard. It\\'s a lot easier to be cynical; to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is, all the folks who are elected don\\'t care; and to believe that our voices and our actions don\\'t matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don\\'t look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background. \\n\\nWe can\\'t afford to go down that path. It won\\'t deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world. \\n\\nSo, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. We need every American to stay active in our public life&mdash;and not just during election time&mdash;so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day. \\n\\nIt is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not, first and foremost, as Black or White or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not Democrat or Republican, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word: voices of \"unarmed truth and unconditional love.\" \\n\\nAnd they\\'re out there, those voices. They don\\'t get a lot of attention; they don\\'t seek a lot of fanfare; but they\\'re busy doing the work this country needs doing. I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding. \\n\\nI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off. I see it in the dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early, maybe with some extra supplies that she bought because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease. \\n\\nI see it in the American who served his time, made bad mistakes as a child, but now is dreaming of starting over. And I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance. The protester determined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe. \\n\\nI see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on. It\\'s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he\\'s been taught. \\n\\nI see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to, the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time, the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count. Because each of them, in different ways, know how much that precious right is worth. \\n\\nThat\\'s the America I know. That\\'s the country we love: clear eyed, big hearted, undaunted by challenge. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That\\'s what makes me so hopeful about our future. I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people. And that\\'s why I stand here as confident as I have ever been that the state of our Union is strong. \\n\\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.',\n",
       " u'Thank you all. Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum. In that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. We faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it\\'s fair to say, we\\'ve answered the call. [Laughter] Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose, and together we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government.\\n\\nAll of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people\\'s business. That is the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. It remains our charge to keep. \\n\\nThe actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our Nation long after this session has ended. In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. Let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time. \\n\\nFrom expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we\\'ve made good progress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done. \\n\\nIn the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our Nation great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions and empower them to improve their lives for their futures. \\n\\nTo build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but the housing market has declined. At kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about our economic future. \\n\\nIn the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing. So last week, my administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment. The temptation will be to load up the bill. That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working, and this Congress must pass it as soon as possible. \\n\\nWe have other work to do on taxes. Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we\\'ve delivered over the past 7 years will be taken away. Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their enthusiasm. I\\'m pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders. [Laughter] \\n\\nMost Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other pressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry about their Federal Government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. There\\'s only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Make the tax relief permanent. And Members of Congress should know, if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it. \\n\\nJust as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I\\'ll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion. The budget that I will submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets; so should their Government. \\n\\nThe people\\'s trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks, special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I\\'ll send it back to you with my veto. \\n\\nAnd tomorrow I will issue an Executive order that directs Federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote. \\n\\nOur shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending. On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. And Congress can help even more. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow State housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes. \\n\\nTo build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options. We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not Government control. So I have proposed ending the bias in the Tax Code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer. This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year. \\n\\nCongress must also expand health savings accounts, create association health plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. With all these steps, we will ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor\\'s office, not in the Halls of Congress. \\n\\nOn education, we must trust students to learn, if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams, and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them. \\n\\nSix years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today, no one can deny its results. Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. Reading scores are on the rise. African American and Hispanic students posted alltime highs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibilities for States and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools. \\n\\nMembers of Congress, the No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding, and we owe it to America\\'s children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law. \\n\\nWe must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up. Thanks to the DC Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation\\'s Capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other nonpublic school. Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America\\'s inner cities. So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. And to open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell grants help low-income college students realize their full potential. Together, we\\'ve expanded the size and reach of these grants. Now let us apply the same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools. \\n\\nOn trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world. So we\\'re working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. We\\'re working for a successful Doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. At the same time, we\\'re pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements. \\n\\nI thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea. Many products from these nations now enter America duty free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets. These agreements will level the playing field. They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world, those whose products say \"Made in the U.S.A.\" \\n\\nThese agreements also promote America\\'s strategic interests. The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life. \\n\\nTrade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the Federal Government has a responsibility to help. I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs. \\n\\nTo build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology. Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil. \\n\\nLast year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded. Together, we should take the next steps. Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions. Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power. Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future. Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and China make a greater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases. \\n\\nThis agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy efficient technology. \\n\\nTo keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. So I ask Congress to double Federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth. \\n\\nOn matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life. \\n\\nSo we\\'re expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research. And as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves. And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices, such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life. \\n\\nOn matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says. I\\'ve submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote. \\n\\nIn communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. Over the past 7 years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. Americans have volunteered in record numbers. Charitable donations are higher than ever. Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the Federal Government. And to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for Federal funds, I ask you to permanently extend charitable choice. \\n\\nTonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast. America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before. And tonight I\\'m pleased to announce that in April, we will host this year\\'s North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans. \\n\\nThere are two other pressing challenges that I\\'ve raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration. Every Member in this Chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford. We all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. I\\'ve laid out proposals to reform these programs. Now I ask Members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren. \\n\\nThe other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure our borders, and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so. We\\'re increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. We\\'ve effectively ended the policy of catch-and-release at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm. \\n\\nWe must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals. \\n\\nThis is the business of our Nation here at home. Yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world. \\n\\nOur foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. In the last 7 years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty. We\\'ve seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections. We\\'ve seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence. We\\'ve seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new President and a new parliament. We\\'ve seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. These images of liberty have inspired us. \\n\\nIn the past 7 years, we\\'ve also seen the images that have sobered us. We\\'ve watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin\\'s hand. We\\'ve seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs. On a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant. These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists, evil men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule. \\n\\nSince 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists. We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies. \\n\\nWe are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear. Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories. And that is why, for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom. \\n\\nIn Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country. Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for Al Qaida is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope. These successes must continue, so we\\'re adding 3,200 marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban and Al Qaida is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting America\\'s vital mission in Afghanistan. \\n\\nIn Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. So we reviewed our strategy and changed course. We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq. We gave our troops a new mission: work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country. \\n\\nThe Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country. They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return. And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole Nation. \\n\\nThe Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of Al Qaida\\'s brutality, started a popular uprising called the Anbar Awakening. Over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country. And today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. The Government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well, adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year. \\n\\nWhile the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just 1 year ago. When we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible. A year later, high-profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down. \\n\\nWhen we met last year, militia extremists&mdash;some armed and trained by Iran&mdash; were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters. And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country. \\n\\nWhen we met last year, Al Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is Al Qaida that is searching for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held. And over the past year, we\\'ve captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key Al Qaida leaders and operatives. \\n\\nLast month, Usama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on Al Qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. Al Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated. \\n\\nWhen we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of return on success, and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home. \\n\\nThis progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. This evening I want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines. Soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we\\'ve asked of you and more. Our Nation is grateful for your courage. We are proud of your accomplishments. And tonight in this hallowed Chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our Nation. And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops. \\n\\nOur enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with Iraqi forces and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission. As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced. In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home. \\n\\nAny further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in, quote, \"the disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, Al Qaida-Iraq regaining lost ground, and a marked increase in violence.\" Members of Congress, having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen. \\n\\nIn the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they\\'re making toward political reconciliation. At the local level, Sunnis, Shi\\'a, and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the Provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad. We\\'re seeing some encouraging signs. The national Government is sharing oil revenues with the Provinces. The parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-Ba\\'athification reform. They\\'re now debating a Provincial powers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel, but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place, and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future. \\n\\nThe mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our Nation, but it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed. A free Iraq will deny Al Qaida a safe haven. A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible. A free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world. \\n\\nBy contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland. The enemy has made its intentions clear. At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, Al Qaida\\'s top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington. My fellow Americans, we will not rest either. We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated. We must do the difficult work today so that years from now, people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America. \\n\\nWe\\'re also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have new cause for hope. Palestinians have elected a President who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel. Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security. This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year. The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side by side in peace. \\n\\nWe\\'re also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran. Iran\\'s rulers oppress a good and talented people. And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it. Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hizballah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land. Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon. \\n\\nOur message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you. We respect your traditions and your history. We look forward to the day when you have your freedom. Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad. But above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops, we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf. \\n\\nOn the homefront, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country. This is our most solemn duty. We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11. This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. In the past 6 years, we\\'ve stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in our Government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. These good citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this Chamber owes them our thanks. \\n\\nAnd we owe them something more; we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe. And one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications. To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they\\'re planning. Last year, Congress passed legislation to help us do that. Unfortunately, Congress set the legislations to expire on February the 1st. That means if you don\\'t act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger. Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted. Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America. We\\'ve had ample time for debate. The time to act is now. \\n\\nProtecting our Nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military. It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair. So America is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world. This is a reflection of our national interests; it is the calling of our conscience. \\n\\nAmerica opposes genocide in Sudan. We support freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma. \\n\\nAmerica is leading the fight against global poverty with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance. We\\'ve also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account. This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative. \\n\\nAmerica is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than half the world\\'s food aid comes from the United States. And tonight I ask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine. \\n\\nAmerica is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we\\'re working to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people. We can bring healing and hope to many more. So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success. And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the next 5 years. \\n\\nAmerica is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over the past 7 years, we\\'ve increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. And as we increase funding, we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation. I call on Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity. \\n\\nOur military families also sacrifice for America. They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home. We have a responsibility to provide for them. So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the Federal Government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children. Our military families serve our Nation, they inspire our Nation, and tonight our Nation honors them. \\n\\nThe strength&mdash;the secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness lies not in our Government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. When the Federal Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our Nation was bound by the Articles of Confederation, which began with the words, \"We the undersigned delegates.\" When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our new Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our Nation and the history of the world: \"We the people.\" \\n\\nBy trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women. By trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile, young democracy into the most powerful nation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions. And so long as we continue to trust the people, our Nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our Union will remain strong. \\n\\nSo tonight, with confidence in freedom\\'s power and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business. God bless America.',\n",
       " u'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans:\\n\\nWe are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has our Nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity and, therefore, such a profound obligation to build the more perfect Union of our Founders\\' dreams. \\n\\nWe begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first back-to-back surpluses in 42 years; and next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history. We have built a new economy. \\n\\nAnd our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American spirit: crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years; teen births down 7 years in a row; adoptions up by 30 percent; welfare rolls cut in half, to their lowest levels in 30 years. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans, the state of our Union is the strongest it has ever been. \\n\\nAs always, the real credit belongs to the American people. My gratitude also goes to those of you in this Chamber who have worked with us to put progress over partisanship. \\n\\nEight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our Nation was gripped by economic distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best-selling book asked: \"America: What Went Wrong?\" \\n\\nIn the best traditions of our Nation, Americans determined to set things right. We restored the vital center, replacing outmoded ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans. We reinvented Government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility and give our people the tools they need to solve their own problems. \\n\\nWith the smallest Federal work force in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record surpluses and doubled our investment in education. We cut crime with 100,000 community police and the Brady law, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals. \\n\\nWe ended welfare as we knew it, requiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children and investing more in child care, transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We\\'ve helped parents to succeed at home and at work with family leave, which 20 million Americans have now used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one. We\\'ve engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through AmeriCorps, while helping them earn money for college. \\n\\nIn 1992, we just had a roadmap. Today, we have results. \\n\\nEven more important, America again has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not let this confidence drift into complacency. For we, all of us, will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed, because our chance to do good is so great. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century. Now, we must shape a 21st century American revolution of opportunity, responsibility, and community. We must be now, as we were in the beginning, a new nation. \\n\\nAt the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, \"The one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight . . . it should be the growing Nation with a future that takes the long look ahead.\" So tonight let us take our long look ahead and set great goals for our Nation. \\n\\nTo 21st century America, let us pledge these things: Every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work, and no child will be raised in poverty. We will meet the challenge of the aging of America. We will assure quality, affordable health care, at last, for all Americans. We will make America the safest big country on Earth. We will pay off our national debt for the first time since 1835.* We will bring prosperity to every American community. We will reverse the course of climate change and leave a safer, cleaner planet. America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology. And we will become at last what our Founders pledged us to be so long ago: One Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. \\n\\nThese are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them all this year, not even in this decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember that the first American Revolution was not won with a single shot; the continent was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history and the lesson of the last 7 years is that great goals are reached step by step, always building on our progress, always gaining ground. \\n\\nOf course, you can\\'t gain ground if you\\'re standing still. And for too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities. So let\\'s begin tonight with them. \\n\\nAgain, I ask you to pass a real Patients\\' Bill of Rights. I ask you to pass commonsense gun safety legislation. I ask you to pass campaign finance reform. I ask you to vote up or down on judicial nominations and other important appointees. And again, I ask you&mdash;I implore you to raise the minimum wage. \\n\\nNow, 2 years ago&mdash;let me try to balance the seesaw here&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;2 years ago, as we reached across party lines to reach our first balanced budget, I asked that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal discipline. Because we refused to stray from that path, we are doing something that would have seemed unimaginable 7 years ago. We are actually paying down the national debt. Now, if we stay on this path, we can pay down the debt entirely in just 13 years now and make America debt-free for the first time since Andrew Jackson was President in 1835. \\n\\nIn 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you\\'ll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom. He\\'s here with us tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you. \\n\\nBeyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every American, Social Security and Medicare. Tonight I ask you to work with me to make a bipartisan downpayment on Social Security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security Trust Fund so that it will be strong and sound for the next 50 years. \\n\\nBut this is just the start of our journey. We must also take the right steps toward reaching our great goals. First and foremost, we need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our faith that every single child can learn. Because education is more important than ever, more than ever the key to our children\\'s future, we must make sure all our children have that key. That means quality preschool and afterschool, the best trained teachers in the classroom, and college opportunities for all our children. \\n\\nFor 7 years now, we\\'ve worked hard to improve our schools, with opportunity and responsibility, investing more but demanding more in turn. Reading, math, college entrance scores are up. Some of the most impressive gains are in schools in very poor neighborhoods. \\n\\nBut all successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher standards, more accountability, and extra help so children who need it can get it to reach those standards. I have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. It holds States and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results. Each year, our National Government invests more than $15 billion in our schools. It is time to support what works and stop supporting what doesn\\'t. \\n\\nNow, as we demand more from our schools, we should also invest more in our schools. Let\\'s double our investment to help States and districts turn around their worst performing schools or shut them down. Let\\'s double our investments in after-school and summer school programs, which boost achievement and keep people off the streets and out of trouble. If we do this, we can give every single child in every failing school in America&mdash;everyone&mdash;the chance to meet high standards. \\n\\nSince 1993, we\\'ve nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and improved its quality. Tonight I ask you for another $1 billion for Head Start, the largest increase in the history of the program. \\n\\nWe know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers. For 2 years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to hire 100,000 new qualified teachers to lower class size in the early grades. I thank you for that, and I ask you to make it 3 in a row. And to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I propose a new teacher quality initiative, to recruit more talented people into the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and give all teachers the training they need. \\n\\nWe know charter schools provide real public school choice. When I became President, there was just one independent public charter school in all America. Today, thanks to you, there are 1,700. I ask you now to help us meet our goal of 3,000 charter schools by next year. \\n\\nWe know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet, and we\\'re getting there. In 1994, only 3 percent of our classrooms were connected. Today, with the help of the Vice President\\'s E-rate program, more than half of them are, and 90 percent of our schools have at least one Internet connection. But we cannot finish the job when a third of all our schools are in serious disrepair. Many of them have walls and wires so old, they\\'re too old for the Internet. So tonight I propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate and urgent repairs and, again, to help build or modernize 6,000 more, to get students out of trailers and into high-tech classrooms. \\n\\nI ask all of you to help me double our bipartisan GEAR UP program, which provides mentors for disadvantaged young people. If we double it, we can provide mentors for 1.4 million of them. Let\\'s also offer these kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the same chance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students use to boost their test scores. \\n\\nTo make the American dream achievable for all, we must make college affordable for all. For 7 years, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken action toward that goal: larger Pell grants, more affordable student loans, education IRA\\'s, and our HOPE scholarships, which have already benefited 5 million young people. \\n\\nNow, 67 percent of high school graduates are going on to college. That\\'s up 10 percent since 1993. Yet millions of families still strain to pay college tuition. They need help. So I propose a landmark $30 billion college opportunity tax cut, a middle class tax deduction for up to $10,000 in college tuition costs. The previous actions of this Congress have already made 2 years of college affordable for all. It\\'s time make 4 years of college affordable for all. If we take all these steps, we\\'ll move a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed. \\n\\nWe also need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen families by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most important work of all, raising children. That means making sure every family has health care and the support to care for aging parents, the tools to bring their children up right, and that no child grows up in poverty. \\n\\nFrom my first days as President, we\\'ve worked to give families better access to better health care. In 1997, we passed the Children\\'s Health Insurance Program&mdash;CHIP&mdash;so that workers who don\\'t have coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children. So far, we\\'ve enrolled 2 million children. We\\'re well on our way to our goal of 5 million. \\n\\nBut there are still more than 40 million of our fellow Americans without health insurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight I propose that we follow Vice President Gore\\'s suggestion to make low income parents eligible for the insurance that covers their children. Together with our children\\'s initiative&mdash;think of this&mdash;together with our children\\'s initiative, this action would enable us to cover nearly a quarter of all the uninsured people in America. \\n\\nAgain, I want to ask you to let people between the ages of 55 and 65, the fastest growing group of uninsured, buy into Medicare. And this year I propose to give them a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one. I hope you will support that, as well. \\n\\nWhen the baby boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for twice as many of our citizens; yet, it is far from ready to do so. My generation must not ask our children\\'s generation to shoulder our burden. We simply must act now to strengthen and modernize Medicare. \\n\\nMy budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it more efficient and more competitive. And it dedicates nearly $400 billion of our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025. And at long last, it also provides funds to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drugs. \\n\\nLifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one creating a Medicare program today would even think of excluding coverage for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five of our seniors now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives. Millions of older Americans, who need prescription drugs the most, pay the highest prices for them. In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to all our seniors this lifeline of affordable prescription drugs. \\n\\nRecord numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home. It\\'s a loving but a difficult and often very expensive choice. Last year, I proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care. Frankly, it wasn\\'t enough. This year, let\\'s triple it to $3,000. But this year, let\\'s pass it. \\n\\nWe also have to make needed investments to expand access to mental health care. I want to take a moment to thank the person who led our first White House Conference on Mental Health last year and who for 7 years has led all our efforts to break down the barriers to decent treatment of people with mental illness. Thank you, Tipper Gore. \\n\\nTaken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in health care in the 35 years since Medicare was created&mdash;the largest investment in 35 years. That would be a big step toward assuring quality health care for all Americans, young and old. And I ask you to embrace them and pass them. \\n\\nWe must also make investments that reward work and support families. Nothing does that better than the earned-income tax credit, the EITC. The \"E\" in the EITC is about earning, working, taking responsibility, and being rewarded for it. In my very first address to you, I asked Congress to greatly expand this credit, and you did. As a result, in 1998 alone, the EITC helped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way out of poverty toward the middle class. That\\'s double the number in 1993. \\n\\nTonight I propose another major expansion of the EITC: to reduce the marriage penalty, to make sure it rewards marriage as it rewards work, and also to expand the tax credit for families that have more than two children. It punishes people with more than two children today. Our proposal would allow families with three or more children to get up to $1,100 more in tax relief. These are working families; their children should not be in poverty. \\n\\nWe also can\\'t reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for equal work. Today the female unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 46 years. Yet, women still only earn about 75 cents for every dollar men earn. We must do better, by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws, training more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing the \"Paycheck Fairness Act.\" \\n\\nMany working parents spend up to a quarter&mdash;a quarter&mdash;of their income on child care. Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about 2 million children. My child care initiative before you now, along with funds already secured in welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more affordable for another 400,000 children. I ask you to pass that. They need it out there. \\n\\nFor hard-pressed middle income families, we should also expand the child care tax credit. And I believe strongly we should take the next big step and make that tax credit refundable for low income families. For people making under $30,000 a year, that could mean up to $2,400 for child care costs. You know, we all say we\\'re pro-work and pro-family. Passing this proposal would prove it. \\n\\nTen of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard as they work, they still don\\'t have the opportunity to save. Too few can make use of IRA\\'s and 401k plans. We should do more to help all working families save and accumulate wealth. That\\'s the idea behind the Individual Development Accounts, the IDA\\'s. I ask you to take that idea to a new level, with new retirement savings accounts that enable every low and moderate income family in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical emergency, or a college education. I propose to match their contributions, however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save. And I propose to give a major new tax credit to any small business that will provide a meaningful pension to its workers. Those people ought to have retirement as well as the rest of us. \\n\\nNearly one in three American children grows up without a father. These children are 5 times more likely to live in poverty than children with both parents at home. Clearly, demanding and supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all our children out of poverty. We\\'ve doubled child support collections since 1992. And I\\'m proposing to you tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible. \\n\\nBut we should recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their children but need help to do it. Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minnesota, wanted to do right by his son, and he got the help to do it. Now he\\'s got a good job, and he supports his little boy. My budget will help 40,000 more fathers make the same choices Carlos Rosas did. I thank him for being here tonight. Stand up, Carlos. [Applause] Thank you. \\n\\nIf there is any single issue on which we should be able to reach across party lines, it is in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Just remember what we did last year. We came together to help people with disabilities keep their health insurance when they go to work. And I thank you for that. Thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved foster care. We\\'ve helped those young people who leave it when they turn 18, and we have dramatically increased the number of foster care children going into adoptive homes. I thank all of you for all of that. \\n\\nOf course, I am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning and who\\'s worked so tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now, my wife, Hillary, and I thank her. \\n\\nIf we take the steps just discussed, we can go a long, long way toward empowering parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised in poverty. We can make these vital investments in health care, education, support for working families, and still offer tax cuts to help pay for college, for retirement, to care for aging parents, to reduce the marriage penalty. We can do these things without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us to this point here tonight. Indeed, we must make these investments and these tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the national debt. \\n\\nCrime in America has dropped for the past 7 years&mdash;that\\'s the longest decline on record&mdash; thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention. But nobody, nobody here, nobody in America believes we\\'re safe enough. So again, I ask you to set a higher goal. Let\\'s make this country the safest big country in the world. \\n\\nLast fall, Congress supported my plan to hire, in addition to the 100,000 community police we\\'ve already funded, 50,000 more, concentrated in high-crime neighborhoods. I ask your continued support for that. \\n\\nSoon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered commonsense gun legislation, to require Brady background checks at the gun shows, child safety locks for new handguns, and a ban on the importation of large capacity ammunition clips. With courage and a tie-breaking vote by the Vice President&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood up for the American people, and passed this legislation. But the House failed to follow suit. \\n\\nNow, we have all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands. Daniel Mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at Columbine. He was an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. Like all parents who lose their children, his father, Tom, has borne unimaginable grief. Somehow he has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into action. Earlier this month, he took a leave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws. I pray that his courage and wisdom will at long last move this Congress to make commonsense gun legislation the very next order of business. Tom Mauser, stand up. We thank you for being here tonight. Tom. Thank you, Tom. [Applause] \\n\\nWe must strengthen our gun laws and enforce those already on the books better. Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office. But we must do more. I propose to hire more Federal and local gun prosecutors and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and bad-apple dealers. And we must give them the enforcement tools that they need, tools to trace every gun and every bullet used in every gun crime in the United States. I ask you to help us do that. \\n\\nEvery State in this country already requires hunters and automobile drivers to have a license. I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases. Now, specifically, I propose a plan to ensure that all new handgun buyers must first have a photo license from their State showing they passed the Brady background check and a gun safety course, before they get the gun. I hope you\\'ll help me pass that in this Congress. \\n\\nListen to this&mdash;listen to this. The accidental gun rate&mdash;the accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the United States is 9 times higher than in the other 25 industrialized countries combined. Now, technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them. I ask Congress to fund research into smart gun technology to save these children\\'s lives. I ask responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands, to keep our children safe. \\n\\nYou know, every parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media on their children. I want to begin by thanking the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet games. But frankly, the ratings are too numerous, diverse, and confusing to be really useful to parents. So tonight I ask the industry to accept the First Lady\\'s challenge to develop a single voluntary rating system for all children\\'s entertainment that is easier for parents to understand and enforce. \\n\\nThe steps I outline will take us well on our way to making America the safest big country in the world. \\n\\nNow, to keep our historic economic expansion going, the subject of a lot of discussion in this community and others, I believe we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets, start new businesses, hire new workers right here in America, in our inner cities, poor rural areas, and Native American reservations. \\n\\nOur Nation\\'s prosperity hasn\\'t yet reached these places. Over the last 6 months, I\\'ve traveled to a lot of them, joined by many of you and many far-sighted business people, to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from Watts to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Everywhere I go, I meet talented people eager for opportunity and able to work. Tonight I ask you, let\\'s put them to work. For business, it\\'s the smart thing to do. For America, it\\'s the right thing to do. And let me ask you something: If we don\\'t do this now, when in the wide world will we ever get around to it? \\n\\nSo I ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in America\\'s new markets they now have to invest in markets overseas. Tonight I propose a large new markets tax credit and other incentives to spur $22 billion in private-sector capital to create new businesses and new investments in our inner cities and rural areas. Because empowerment zones have been creating these opportunities for 5 years now, I also ask you to increase incentives to invest in them and to create more of them. \\n\\nAnd let me say to all of you again what I have tried to say at every turn: This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. Giving people a chance to live their dreams is an American issue. \\n\\nMr. Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you joined Reverend Jesse Jackson and me in your home State of Illinois and committed to working toward our common goal by combining the best ideas from both sides of the aisle. I want to thank you again and to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with you. This is a worthy joint endeavor. Thank you. \\n\\nI also ask you to make special efforts to address the areas of our Nation with the highest rates of poverty, our Native American reservations and the Mississippi Delta. My budget includes a $110 million initiative to promote economic development in the Delta and a billion dollars to increase economic opportunity, health care, education, and law enforcement for our Native American communities. We should begin this new century by honoring our historic responsibility to empower the first Americans. And I want to thank tonight the leaders and the members from both parties who\\'ve expressed to me an interest in working with us on these efforts. They are profoundly important. \\n\\nThere\\'s another part of our American community in trouble tonight, our family farmers. When I signed the farm bill in 1996, I said there was great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad. Well, droughts, floods, and historically low prices have made these times very bad for the farmers. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety net, invest in land conservation, and create some new markets for them by expanding our programs for bio-based fuels and products. Please, they need help. Let\\'s do it together. \\n\\nOpportunity for all requires something else today, having access to a computer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the digital divide between those who\\'ve got the tools and those who don\\'t. Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it\\'s just a start. My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach 21st century skills, and it creates technology centers in 1,000 communities to serve adults. This spring, I\\'ll invite high-tech leaders to join me on another new markets tour, to close the digital divide and open opportunity for our people. I want to thank the high-tech companies that already are doing so much in this area. I hope the new tax incentives I have proposed will get all the rest of them to join us. This is a national crusade. We have got to do this and do it quickly. \\n\\nNow, again I say to you, these are steps, but step by step, we can go a long way toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community. \\n\\nTo realize the full possibilities of this economy, we must reach beyond our own borders to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals and economies and cultures: globalization. It\\'s the central reality of our time. \\n\\nOf course, change this profound is both liberating and threatening to people. But there\\'s no turning back. And our open, creative society stands to benefit more than any other if we understand and act on the realities of interdependence. We have to be at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and a good partner. We have to recognize that we cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs. \\n\\nThe first thing we have got to do is to forge a new consensus on trade. Now, those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade, we have to ensure that it lifts both our living standards and our values, never tolerating abusive child labor or a race to the bottom in the environment and worker protection. But others must recognize that open markets and rule-based trade are the best engines we know of for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas. \\n\\nI believe, as strongly tonight as I did the first day I got here, the only direction forward for America on trade&mdash;the only direction for America on trade is to keep going forward. I ask you to help me forge that consensus. We have to make developing economies our partners in prosperity. That\\'s why I would like to ask you again to finalize our groundbreaking African and Caribbean Basin trade initiatives. \\n\\nBut globalization is about more than economics. Our purpose must be to bring together the world around freedom and democracy and peace and to oppose those who would tear it apart. Here are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to shape the 21st century world. \\n\\nFirst, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia and China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations. Both are being held back today from reaching their full potential: Russia by the legacy of communism, an economy in turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom. \\n\\nBut think how much has changed in the past decade: 5,000 former Soviet nuclear weapons taken out of commission; Russian soldiers actually serving with ours in the Balkans; Russian people electing their leaders for the first time in 1,000 years; and in China, an economy more open to the world than ever before. \\n\\nOf course, no one, not a single person in this Chamber tonight can know for sure what direction these great nations will take. But we do know for sure that we can choose what we do. And we should do everything in our power to increase the chance that they will choose wisely, to be constructive members of our global community. \\n\\nThat\\'s why we should support those Russians who are struggling for a democratic, prosperous future; continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals; and help Russia to safeguard weapons and materials that remain. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I believe Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring China into the WTO, by passing permanent normal trade relations with China as soon as possible this year. I think you ought to do it for two reasons: First of all, our markets are already open to China; this agreement will open China\\'s markets to us. And second, it will plainly advance the cause of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China. No, we don\\'t know where it\\'s going. All we can do is decide what we\\'re going to do. But when all is said and done, we need to know we did everything we possibly could to maximize the chance that China will choose the right future. \\n\\nA second challenge we\\'ve got is to protect our own security from conflicts that pose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. We can\\'t prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference, we should be, and we must be, peacemakers. \\n\\nWe should be proud of our role in bringing the Middle East closer to a lasting peace, building peace in Northern Ireland, working for peace in East Timor and Africa, promoting reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus, working to defuse these crises between India and Pakistan, in defending human rights and religious freedom. And we should be proud of the men and women of our Armed Forces and those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, enabling a million people to return to their homes. \\n\\nWhen Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Captain John Cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when another American plane was shot down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our Armed Forces\\' skill and bravery, we prevailed in Kosovo without losing a single American in combat. I want to introduce Captain Cherrey to you. We honor Captain Cherrey, and we promise you, Captain, we\\'ll finish the job you began. Stand up so we can see you. [Applause] \\n\\nA third challenge we have is to keep this inexorable march of technology from giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our defenses. Keep in mind, the same technological advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use. \\n\\nWe must meet this threat by making effective agreements to restrain nuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow of lethal technology to Iran, preventing Iraq from threatening its neighbors, increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack, protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals, and developing a system to defend against new missile threats, while working to preserve our ABM missile treaty with Russia. We must do all these things. \\n\\nI predict to you, when most of us are long gone but some time in the next 10 to 20 years, the major security threat this country will face will come from the enemies of the nation-state, the narcotraffickers and the terrorists and the organized criminals who will be organized together, working together, with increasing access to ever more sophisticated chemical and biological weapons. And I want to thank the Pentagon and others for doing what they\\'re doing right now to try to help protect us and plan for that, so that our defenses will be strong. I ask for your support to ensure they can succeed. \\n\\nI also want to ask you for a constructive bipartisan dialog this year to work to build a consensus which I hope will eventually lead to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \\n\\nI hope we can also have a constructive effort to meet the challenge that is presented to our planet by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept a world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy and the rest live on the bare edge of survival. I think we have to do our part to change that with expanded trade, expanded aid, and the expansion of freedom. \\n\\nThis is interesting: From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people got the right to choose their leaders in 1999 than in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. We\\'ve got to stand by these democracies, including and especially tonight Colombia, which is fighting narcotraffickers, for its own people\\'s lives and our children\\'s lives. I have proposed a strong 2-year package to help Colombia win this fight. I want to thank the leaders in both parties in both Houses for listening to me and the President of Colombia about it. We have got to pass this. I want to ask your help. A lot is riding on it. And it\\'s so important for the long-term stability of our country and for what happens in Latin America. \\n\\nI also want you to know I\\'m going to send you new legislation to go after what these drug barons value the most, their money. And I hope you\\'ll pass that as well. \\n\\nIn a world where over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we also have got to do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries, so they can invest in education, health care, and economic growth. That\\'s what the Pope and other religious leaders have urged us to do. And last year, Congress made a downpayment on America\\'s share. I ask you to continue that. I thank you for what you did and ask you to stay the course. \\n\\nI also want to say that America must help more nations to break the bonds of disease. Last year in Africa, 10 times as many people died from AIDS as were killed in wars&mdash;10 times. The budget I give you invests $150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers. And today I propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for diseases like malaria, TB, and AIDS. I ask the private sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this cause. We can save millions of lives together, and we ought to do it. \\n\\nI also want to mention our final challenge, which, as always, is the most important. I ask you to pass a national security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the world, with heightened readiness and 21st century weapons, which raises salaries for our service men and women, which protects our veterans, which fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war, which makes good on our commitment to our U.N. dues and arrears. I ask you to pass this budget. \\n\\nI also want to say something, if I might, very personal tonight. The American people watching us at home, with the help of all the commentators, can tell, from who stands and who sits and who claps and who doesn\\'t, that there\\'s still modest differences of opinion in this room. [Laughter] But I want to thank you for something, every one of you. I want to thank you for the extraordinary support you have given, Republicans and Democrats alike, to our men and women in uniform. I thank you for that. \\n\\nI also want to thank, especially, two people. First, I want to thank our Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to national security. Thank you, sir. Even more, I want to thank his wife, Janet, who, more than any other American citizen, has tirelessly traveled this world to show the support we all feel for our troops. Thank you, Janet Cohen. I appreciate that. Thank you. \\n\\nThese are the challenges we have to meet so that we can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization. \\n\\nI want to tell you that I am very grateful for many things as President. But one of the things I\\'m grateful for is the opportunity that the Vice President and I have had to finally put to rest the bogus idea that you cannot grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time. \\n\\nAs our economy has grown, we\\'ve rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste, ensured cleaner air and water for millions of people. In the past 3 months alone, we\\'ve helped preserve 40 million acres of roadless lands in the national forests, created three new national monuments. \\n\\nBut as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must continue to grow. Tonight I propose creating a permanent conservation fund, to restore wildlife, protect coastlines, save natural treasures, from the California redwoods to the Florida Everglades. This lands legacy endowment would represent by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed in this House. I hope we can get together with all the people with different ideas and do this. This is a gift we should give to our children and our grandchildren for all time, across party lines. We can make an agreement to do this. \\n\\nLast year the Vice President launched a new effort to make communities more liberal&mdash;livable&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;liberal, I know. [Laughter] Wait a minute, I\\'ve got a punchline now. That\\'s this year\\'s agenda; last year was livable, right? [Laughter] That\\'s what Senator Lott is going to say in the commentary afterwards&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;to make our communities more livable. This is big business. This is a big issue. What does that mean? You ask anybody that lives in an unlivable community, and they\\'ll tell you. They want their kids to grow up next to parks, not parking lots; the parents don\\'t have to spend all their time stalled in traffic when they could be home with their children. \\n\\nTonight I ask you to support new funding for the following things, to make American communities more liberal&mdash;livable. [Laughter] I\\'ve done pretty well with this speech, but I can\\'t say that. \\n\\nOne, I want you to help us to do three things. We need more funding for advanced transit systems. We need more funding for saving open spaces in places of heavy development. And we need more funding&mdash;this ought to have bipartisan appeal&mdash;we need more funding for helping major cities around the Great Lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life. We need these things, and I want you to help us. \\n\\nThe greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming. The scientists tell us the 1990\\'s were the hottest decade of the entire millennium. If we fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will flood, and economies will be disrupted. That is going to happen, unless we act. \\n\\nMany people in the United States, some people in this Chamber, and lots of folks around the world still believe you cannot cut greenhouse gas emissions without slowing economic growth. In the industrial age, that may well have been true. But in this digital economy, it is not true anymore. New technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even more growth. \\n\\nFor example, just last week, automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon, the fruits of a unique research partnership between Government and industry. And before you know it, efficient production of bio-fuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gasoline. \\n\\nTo speed innovation in these kind of technologies, I think we should give a major tax incentive to business for the production of clean energy and to families for buying energy-saving homes and appliances and the next generation of superefficient cars when they hit the showroom floor. I also ask the auto industry to use the available technologies to make all new cars more fuel-efficient right away. \\n\\nAnd I ask this Congress to do something else. Please help us make more of our clean energy technology available to the developing world. That will create cleaner growth abroad and a lot more new jobs here in the United States of America. \\n\\nIn the new century, innovations in science and technology will be key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy. Later this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the entire human genome, the very blueprint of life. It is important for all our fellow Americans to recognize that Federal tax dollars have funded much of this research and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease. \\n\\nFor example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson\\'s, diabetes, and certain kinds of cancer. They are designing precision therapies that will block the harmful effect of these genes for good. Researchers already are using this new technique to target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer\\'s. Scientists are also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see and&mdash;listen to this&mdash;microchips that would actually directly stimulate damaged spinal cords in a way that could allow people now paralyzed to stand up and walk. \\n\\nThese kinds of innovations are also propelling our remarkable prosperity. Information technology only includes 8 percent of our employment but now accounts for a third of our economic growth along with jobs that pay, by the way, about 80 percent above the private sector average. Again, we ought to keep in mind, Government-funded research brought supercomputers, the Internet, and communications satellites into being. Soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can talk, materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight, and&mdash; this is unbelievable to me&mdash;molecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power of today\\'s fastest supercomputers. \\n\\nTo accelerate the march of discovery across all these disciplines in science and technology, I ask you to support my recommendation of an unprecedented $3 billion in the 21st century research fund, the largest increase in civilian research in a generation. We owe it to our future. \\n\\nNow, these new breakthroughs have to be used in ways that reflect our values. First and foremost, we have to safeguard our citizens\\' privacy. Last year we proposed to protect every citizen\\'s medical record. This year we will finalize those rules. We\\'ve also taken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card records and other financial statements. Soon I will send legislation to you to finish that job. We must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination whatever by employers or insurers. I hope you will support that. \\n\\nThese steps will allow us to lead toward the far frontiers of science and technology. They will enhance our health, the environment, the economy in ways we can\\'t even imagine today. But we all know that at a time when science, technology, and the forces of globalization are bringing so many changes into all our lives, it\\'s more important than ever that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in our national community. \\n\\nNo tie binds different people together like citizen service. There\\'s a new spirit of service in America, a movement we\\'ve tried to support with AmeriCorps, expanded Peace Corps, unprecedented new partnerships with businesses, foundations, community groups; partnerships, for example, like the one that enlisted 12,000 companies which have now moved 650,000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to work; partnerships to battle drug abuse, AIDS, teach young people to read, save America\\'s treasures, strengthen the arts, fight teen pregnancy, prevent violence among young people, promote racial healing. The American people are working together. \\n\\nBut we should do more to help Americans help each other. First, we should help faithbased organizations to do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help people get back on the right track, with initiatives like Second Chance Homes that do so much to help unwed teen mothers. Second, we should support Americans who tithe and contribute to charities but don\\'t earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it. Tonight I propose new tax incentives that would allow low and middle income citizens who don\\'t itemize to get that deduction. It\\'s nothing but fair, and it will get more people to give. \\n\\nWe should do more to help new immigrants to fully participate in our community. That\\'s why I recommend spending more to teach them civics and English. And since everybody in our community counts, we\\'ve got to make sure everyone is counted in this year\\'s census. \\n\\nWithin 10 years&mdash;just 10 years&mdash;there will be no majority race in our largest State of California. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race in America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our greatest strength. Just look around this Chamber. Look around. We have Members in this Congress from virtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background. And I think you would agree that America is stronger because of it. [Applause] \\n\\nYou also have to agree that all those differences you just clapped for all too often spark hatred and division even here at home. Just in the last couple of years, we\\'ve seen a man dragged to death in Texas just because he was black. We saw a young man murdered in Wyoming just because he was gay. Last year we saw the shootings of African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Jewish children just because of who they were. This is not the American way, and we must draw the line. \\n\\nI ask you to draw that line by passing without delay the \"Hate Crimes Prevention Act\" and the \"Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\" And I ask you to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. \\n\\nFinally tonight, I propose the largest ever investment in our civil rights laws for enforcement, because no American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home, getting a job, going to school, or securing a loan. Protections in law should be protections in fact. \\n\\nLast February, because I thought this was so important, I created the White House Office of One America to promote racial reconciliation. That\\'s what one of my personal heroes, Hank Aaron, has done all his life. From his days as our all-time home run king to his recent acts of healing, he has always brought people together. We should follow his example, and we\\'re honored to have him with us tonight. Stand up, Hank Aaron. [Applause] \\n\\nI just want to say one more thing about this, and I want every one of you to think about this the next time you get mad at one of your colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This fall, at the White House, Hillary had one of her millennium dinners, and we had this very distinguished scientist there, who is an expert in this whole work in the human genome. And he said that we are all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9 percent the same. \\n\\nNow, you may find that uncomfortable when you look around here. [Laughter] But it is worth remembering. We can laugh about this, but you think about it. Modern science has confirmed what ancient faiths have always taught: the most important fact of life is our common humanity. Therefore, we should do more than just tolerate our diversity; we should honor it and celebrate it. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans, every time I prepare for the State of the Union, I approach it with hope and expectation and excitement for our Nation. But tonight is very special, because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium. Behind us we can look back and see the great expanse of American achievement, and before us we can see even greater, grander frontiers of possibility. We should, all of us, be filled with gratitude and humility for our present progress and prosperity. We should be filled with awe and joy at what lies over the horizon. And we should be filled with absolute determination to make the most of it. \\n\\nYou know, when the Framers finished crafting our Constitution in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin stood in Independence Hall, and he reflected on the carving of the Sun that was on the back of a chair he saw. The Sun was low on the horizon. So he said this&mdash;he said, \"I\\'ve often wondered whether that Sun was rising or setting. Today,\" Franklin said, \"I have the happiness to know it\\'s a rising Sun.\" Today, because each succeeding generation of Americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers of possibility, we all still bask in the glow and the warmth of Mr. Franklin\\'s rising Sun. \\n\\nAfter 224 years, the American revolution continues. We remain a new nation. And as long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be forever young. That is our destiny. And this is our moment. \\n\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.NOTE: The President spoke at 9:18 p.m. in the House Chamber of the Capitol. In his remarks, he referred to Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder and president, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition; President Slobodan Milosevic of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro); President Andres Pastrana of Colombia; Pope John Paul II; and Eric Lander, director, Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research, who spoke at the eighth White House Millennium Evening. \\n\\n* White House correction.',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nMr. Speaker and Mr. President, distinguished Members of Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: \\n\\nThank you very much for that warm reception. You know, with the big buildup this address has had, I wanted to make sure it would be a big hit, but I couldn\\'t convince Barbara to deliver it for me. [Laughter] \\n\\nI see the Speaker and the Vice President are laughing. They saw what I did in Japan, and they\\'re just happy they\\'re sitting behind me. [Laughter] \\n\\nI mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they hold, and of some big problems and how, together, we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age. \\n\\nWe gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in the history of man on Earth. For in the past 12 months, the world has known changes of almost Biblical proportions. And even now, months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system, I\\'m not sure we\\'ve absorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened. But communism died this year. \\n\\nEven as President, with the most fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy managing progress and helping to lead change that I didn\\'t always show the joy that was in my heart. But the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the cold war. \\n\\nI mean to speak this evening of the changes that can take place in our country, now that we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower. Now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what needs to be set right. \\n\\nI will speak of those things. But let me tell you something I\\'ve been thinking these past few months. It\\'s a kind of rollcall of honor. For the cold war didn\\'t end; it was won. And I think of those who won it, in places like Korea and Vietnam. And some of them didn\\'t come back. Back then they were heroes, but this year they were victors. \\n\\nThe long rollcall, all the G.I. Joes and Janes, all the ones who fought faithfully for freedom, who hit the ground and sucked the dust and knew their share of horror. This may seem frivolous, and I don\\'t mean it so, but it\\'s moving to me how the world saw them. The world saw not only their special valor but their special style: their rambunctious, optimistic bravery, their do-or-die unity unhampered by class or race or region. What a group we\\'ve put forth, for generations now, from the ones who wrote \"Kilroy was here\" on the walls of the German stalags to those who left signs in the Iraqi desert that said, \"I saw Elvis.\" What a group of kids we\\'ve sent out into the world. \\n\\nAnd there\\'s another to be singled out, though it may seem inelegant, and I mean a mass of people called the American taxpayer. No one ever thinks to thank the people who pay a country\\'s bill or an alliance\\'s bill. But for half a century now, the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial communism had never existed. But it did; doesn\\'t anymore. And here\\'s a fact I wouldn\\'t mind the world acknowledging: The American taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden and deserves a hunk of the glory. \\n\\nSo now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand down. No longer are they on \\'round-the-clock alert. Tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow. And they won\\'t have, as my children did, air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war. My grandchildren don\\'t have to do that and won\\'t have the bad dreams children had once, in decades past. There are still threats. But the long, drawn-out dread is over. \\n\\nA year ago tonight, I spoke to you at a moment of high peril. American forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm. And after 40 days in the desert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of America\\'s Armed Forces and our allies accomplished the goals that I declared and that you endorsed: We liberated Kuwait. Soon after, the Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace, an historic first. And soon after that, at Christmas, the last American hostages came home. Our policies were vindicated. \\n\\nMuch good can come from the prudent use of power. And much good can come of this: A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power, the United States of America. And they regard this with no dread. For the world trusts us with power, and the world is right. They trust us to be fair and restrained. They trust us to be on the side of decency. They trust us to do what\\'s right. \\n\\nI use those words advisedly. A few days after the war began, I received a telegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the Gulf, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher. Even in her grief, she wanted me to know that some day when her children were old enough, she would tell them \"that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to do.\" And she said it all: It was the right thing to do. \\n\\nAnd we did it together. There were honest differences right here in this Chamber. But when the war began, you put partisanship aside, and we supported our troops. This is still a time for pride, but this is no time to boast. For problems face us, and we must stand together once again and solve them and not let our country down. \\n\\nTwo years ago, I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era. But now, this year, with imperial communism gone, that process can be accelerated. Tonight I can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force. These are actions we are taking on our own because they are the right thing to do. After completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will shut down further production of the B - 2 bombers. We will cancel the small ICBM program. We will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based ballistic missiles. We will stop all new production of the Peacekeeper missile. And we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles. \\n\\nThis weekend I will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation. I\\'ve informed President Yeltsin that if the Commonwealth, the former Soviet Union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead ballistic missiles, I will do the following: We will eliminate all Peacekeeper missiles. We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles by about one-third. And we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bombers to primarily conventional use. President Yeltsin\\'s early response has been very positive, and I expect our talks at Camp David to be fruitful. \\n\\nI want you to know that for half a century, American Presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words. But even in the midst of celebration, we must keep caution as a friend. For the world is still a dangerous place. Only the dead have seen the end of conflict. And though yesterday\\'s challenges are behind us, tomorrow\\'s are being born. \\n\\nThe Secretary of Defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I make them with confidence. But do not misunderstand me. The reductions I have approved will save us an additional $50 billion over the next 5 years. By 1997, we will have cut defense by 30 percent since I took office. These cuts are deep, and you must know my resolve: This deep, and no deeper. To do less would be insensible to progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history. We must not go back to the days of \"the hollow army.\" We cannot repeat the mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if the world were permanently safe. \\n\\nI remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack. We must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms. And I urge you again to pass the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI. \\n\\nThere are those who say that now we can turn away from the world, that we have no special role, no special place. But we are the United States of America, the leader of the West that has become the leader of the world. And as long as I am President, I will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere, not out of arrogance, not out of altruism, but for the safety and security of our children. This is a fact: Strength in the pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no virtue. \\n\\nAnd now to our troubles at home. They\\'re not all economic; the primary problem is our economy. There are some good signs. Inflation, that thief, is down. And interest rates are down. But unemployment is too high, some industries are in trouble, and growth is not what it should be. Let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart, I know we\\'re in hard times. But I know something else: This will not stand. \\n\\nIn this Chamber, in this Chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we brought to Desert Storm. And we can defeat hard times together. I believe you\\'ll help. One reason is that you\\'re patriots, and you want the best for your country. And I believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done because it\\'s the right thing to do. \\n\\nThe power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea, that people will do great things if only you set them free. Well, we\\'re going to set the economy free. For if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything, it\\'s that if we can change the world we can change America. We must encourage investment. We must make it easier for people to invest money and create new products, new industries, and new jobs. We must clear away the obstacles to growth: high taxes, high regulation, redtape, and yes, wasteful Government spending. \\n\\nNone of this will happen with a snap of the fingers, but it will happen. And the test of a plan isn\\'t whether it\\'s called new or dazzling. The American people aren\\'t impressed by gimmicks; they\\'re smarter on this score than all of us in this room. The only test of a plan is: Is it sound, and will it work? \\n\\nWe must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy. And then we need a longer term plan to keep combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy. There are certain things that a President can do without Congress, and I\\'m going to do them. \\n\\nI have, this evening, asked major Cabinet departments and Federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new Federal regulations that could hinder growth. In those 90 days, major departments and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth. \\n\\nFurther, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible American workers and business men and women who\\'ve been forced to go without needed bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end. I won\\'t neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but regulatory overkill must be stopped. And I\\'ve instructed our Government regulators to stop it. \\n\\nI have directed Cabinet departments and Federal agencies to speed up progrowth expenditures as quickly as possible. This should put an extra $10 billion into the economy in the next 6 months. And our new transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being. And that means jobs building roads, jobs building bridges, and jobs building railways. \\n\\nAnd I have, this evening, directed the Secretary of the Treasury to change the Federal tax withholding tables. With this change, millions of Americans from whom the Government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have the Government withhold less from their paychecks. Something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one. This initiative could return about $25 billion back into our economy over the next 12 months, money people can use to help pay for clothing, college, or to get a new car. Finally, working with the Federal Reserve, we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down. \\n\\nNow, these are the things I can do. And now, Members of Congress, let me tell you what you can do for your country. You must pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs. Everyone knows that investment spurs recovery. I am proposing this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new 15-percent investment tax allowance. This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work. \\n\\nReal estate has led our economy out of almost all the tough times we\\'ve ever had. Once building starts, carpenters and plumbers work; people buy homes and take out mortgages. My plan would modify the passive loss rule for active real estate developers. And it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real estate. For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but who can\\'t quite afford it, my plan would allow first-time homebuyers to withdraw savings from IRA\\'s without penalty and provide a $5,000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home. \\n\\nAnd finally, my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to people who own a home, to everyone who has a business or a farm or a single investment. This time, at this hour, I cannot take no for an answer. You must cut the capital gains tax on the people of our country. Never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents. But the demagogs are wrong. They are wrong, and they know it. Sixty percent of the people who benefit from lower capital gains have incomes under $50,000. A cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country. And so, I\\'m asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15.4 percent. \\n\\nI\\'ll tell you, those of you who say, \"Oh, no, someone who\\'s comfortable may benefit from that,\" you kind of remind me of the old definition of the Puritan who couldn\\'t sleep at night, worrying that somehow, someone somewhere was out having a good time. [Laughter] The opponents of this measure and those who have authored various so-called soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this Chamber should be reminded of something: When they aim at the big guy, they usually hit the little guy. And maybe it\\'s time that stopped. \\n\\nThis, then, is my short-term plan. Your part, Members of Congress, requires enactment of these commonsense proposals that will have a strong effect on the economy without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax rates. \\n\\nWhile my plan is being passed and kicking in, we\\'ve got to care for those in trouble today. I have provided for up to $4.4 billion in my budget to extend Federal unemployment benefits. And I ask for congressional action right away. And I thank the committee. [Applause] Well, at last. \\n\\nLet\\'s be frank. Let\\'s be frank. Let me level with you. I know and you know that my plan is unveiled in a political season. [Laughter] I know and you know that everything I propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms. But I ask you to know what is in my heart. And my aim is to increase our Nation\\'s good. I\\'m doing what I think is right, and I am proposing what I know will help. \\n\\nI pride myself that I\\'m a prudent man, and I believe that patience is a virtue. But I understand that politics is, for some, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement. [Laughter] But let me tell you: Far more important than my political future and far more important than yours is the well-being of our country. Members of this Chamber are practical people, and I know you won\\'t resent some practical advice. When people put their party\\'s fortunes, whatever the party, whatever side of this aisle, before the public good, they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves. And they will certainly deserve it. \\n\\nI submit my plan tomorrow, and I\\'m asking you to pass it by March 20th. And I ask the American people to let you know they want this action by March 20th. From the day after that, if it must be, the battle is joined. And you know, when principle is at stake I relish a good, fair fight. \\n\\nI said my plan has two parts, and it does. And it\\'s the second part that is the heart of the matter. For it\\'s not enough to get an immediate burst. We need long-term improvement in our economic position. We all know that the key to our economic future is to ensure that America continues as an economic leader of the world. We have that in our power. Here, then, is my long-term plan to guarantee our future. \\n\\nFirst, trade: We will work to break down the walls that stop world trade. We will work to open markets everywhere. And in our major trade negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage America\\'s farmers and workers. And we\\'ll get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through the North American free trade agreement and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. \\n\\nBut changes are here, and more are coming. The workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever, more people who are computer-literate, highly educated. We must be the world\\'s leader in education. And we must revolutionize America\\'s schools. My America 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal. My plan will give parents more choice, give teachers more flexibility, and help communities create new American schools. Thirty States across the Nation have established America 2000 programs. Hundreds of cities and towns have joined in. Now Congress must join this great movement: Pass my proposals for new American schools. \\n\\nThat was my second long-term proposal, and here\\'s my third: We must make commonsense investments that will help us compete, long-term, in the marketplace. We must encourage research and development. My plan is to make the R&D; tax credit permanent and to provide record levels of support, over $76 billion this year alone, for people who will explore the promise of emerging technologies. \\n\\nFourth, we must do something about crime and drugs. It is time for a major, renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. It saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society and in our future together. Surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely. And surely it\\'s true that everyone who changes his or her life because of crime, from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for, surely these people have been denied a basic civil right. It is time to restore it. Congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill. It is tough on criminals and supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now. Pass it. Help your country. \\n\\nFifth, I ask you tonight to fund our HOPE housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get businesses into the inner city. We must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a home, getting a job, becoming a part of things. My plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage revenue bonds and low-income housing. And I ask tonight for record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want move into excellence, Head Start. \\n\\nStep six, we must reform our health care system. For this, too, bears on whether or not we can compete in the world. American health costs have been exploding. This year America will spend over $800 billion on health, and that is expected to grow to 1.6 trillion by the end of the decade. We simply cannot afford this. The cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell. When health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line costs thousands of dollars, the cost goes into the products he makes, and you pay the bill. \\n\\nWe must make a choice. Now, some pretend we can have it both ways. They call it \"play or pay,\" but that expensive approach is unstable. It will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs, and eventually a system under complete Government control. \\n\\nReally, there are only two options. And we can move toward a nationalized system, a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the Government to ration services arbitrarily. And what we\\'ll get is patients in long lines, indifferent service, and a huge new tax burden. Or we can reform our own private health care system, which still gives us, for all its flaws, the best quality health care in the world. \\n\\nWell, let\\'s build on our strengths. My plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving and increasing the idea of choice. We make basic health insurance affordable for all low-income people not now covered, and we do it by providing a health insurance tax credit of up to $3,750 for each low-income family. And the middle class gets help, too. And by reforming the health insurance market, my plan assures that Americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problems. We must bring costs under control, preserve quality, preserve choice, and reduce the people\\'s nagging daily worry about health insurance. My plan, the details of which I\\'ll announce very shortly, does just that. \\n\\nSeventh, we must get the Federal deficit under control. We now have, in law, enforceable spending caps and a requirement that we pay for the programs we create. There are those in Congress who would ease that discipline now. But I cannot let them do it, and I won\\'t. \\n\\nMy plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority, which means no more next year than this year. I will not tamper with Social Security, but I would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending. And I would also freeze Federal domestic Government employment. And with the help of Congress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don\\'t deserve Federal funding. Some of them have noble titles, but none of them is indispensable. We can get rid of each and every one of them. \\n\\nYou know, it\\'s time we rediscovered a home truth the American people have never forgotten: This Government is too big and spends too much. And I call upon Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of filling the budget with pork barrel appropriations. Every year, the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples: a Lawrence Welk museum, research grants for Belgian endive. We all know how these things get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help you say no. I know how to say it, and I know what I need to make it stick. Give me the same thing 43 Governors have, the line-item veto, and let me help you control spending. \\n\\nWe must put an end to unfinanced Federal Government mandates. These are the requirements Congress puts on our cities, counties, and States without supplying the money. If Congress passes a mandate, it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. After all, a mandate just increases someone else\\'s burden, and that means higher taxes at the State and local level. \\n\\nStep eight, Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting congressional action: bank reform, civil justice reform, tort reform, and my national energy strategy. \\n\\nAnd finally, we must strengthen the family because it is the family that has the greatest bearing on our future. When Barbara holds an AIDS baby in her arms and reads to children, she\\'s saying to every person in this country: Family matters. \\n\\nAnd I am announcing tonight a new Commission on America\\'s Urban Families. I\\'ve asked Missouri\\'s Governor John Ashcroft to be Chairman, former Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss to be Cochair. You know, I had mayors, the leading mayors from the League of Cities, in the other day at the White House, and they told me something striking. They said that every one of them, Republican or Democrat, agreed on one thing, that the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family. They asked for this Commission, and they were right to ask because it\\'s time to determine what we can do to keep families together, strong and sound. \\n\\nThere\\'s one thing we can do right away: Ease the burden of rearing a child. I ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per child for every family. For a family with four kids, that\\'s an increase of $2,000. This is a good start in the right direction, and it\\'s what we can afford. \\n\\nIt\\'s time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans. I am asking you to do just that. And I\\'m asking you to allow people to use money from their IRA\\'s to pay medical and education expenses, all without penalties. \\n\\nAnd I\\'m asking for more. Ask American parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country, and chances are good that pretty soon they\\'ll get to welfare. Americans are the most generous people on Earth. But we have to go back to the insight of Franklin Roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the welfare program, warned that it must not become \"a narcotic\" and a \"subtle destroyer\" of the spirit. Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle. It was never meant to be a habit. It was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy. It\\'s time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system. \\n\\nStates throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when able-bodied people receive Government assistance, they have responsibilities to the taxpayer: A responsibility to seek work, education, or job training; a responsibility to get their lives in order; a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock; and a responsibility to obey the law. We are going to help this movement. Often, State reform requires waiving certain Federal regulations. I will act to make that process easier and quicker for every State that asks for our help. \\n\\nI want to add, as we make these changes, we work together to improve this system, that our intention is not scapegoating or finger-pointing. If you read the papers and watch TV, you know there\\'s been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist comments, anti-Semitism, an increased sense of division. Really, this is not us. This is not who we are. And this is not acceptable. \\n\\nAnd so, you have my plan for America. And I\\'m asking for big things, but I believe in my heart you\\'ll do what\\'s right. \\n\\nYou know, it\\'s kind of an American tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions. I myself have sometimes thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way through Congress. [Laughter] You will deliberate, and you will discuss, and that is fine. But, my friends, the people cannot wait. They need help now. \\n\\nThere\\'s a mood among us. People are worried. There\\'s been talk of decline. Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired. And I thought: Really? You go tell Neil Armstrong standing on the moon. Tell the men and women who put him there. Tell the American farmer who feeds his country and the world. Tell the men and women of Desert Storm. \\n\\nMoods come and go, but greatness endures. Ours does. And maybe for a moment it\\'s good to remember what, in the dailiness of our lives, we forget: We are still and ever the freest nation on Earth, the kindest nation on Earth, the strongest nation on Earth. And we have always risen to the occasion. And we are going to lift this Nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us had better step aside. Because I look at hard times, and I make this vow: This will not stand. \\n\\nAnd so, we move on together, a rising nation, the once and future miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless our beloved country. Thank you very, very much.']"

       "u'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans:\\n\\nWe are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has our Nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity and, therefore, such a profound obligation to build the more perfect Union of our Founders\\' dreams. \\n\\nWe begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first back-to-back surpluses in 42 years; and next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history. We have built a new economy. \\n\\nAnd our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American spirit: crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years; teen births down 7 years in a row; adoptions up by 30 percent; welfare rolls cut in half, to their lowest levels in 30 years. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans, the state of our Union is the strongest it has ever been. \\n\\nAs always, the real credit belongs to the American people. My gratitude also goes to those of you in this Chamber who have worked with us to put progress over partisanship. \\n\\nEight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our Nation was gripped by economic distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best-selling book asked: \"America: What Went Wrong?\" \\n\\nIn the best traditions of our Nation, Americans determined to set things right. We restored the vital center, replacing outmoded ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans. We reinvented Government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility and give our people the tools they need to solve their own problems. \\n\\nWith the smallest Federal work force in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record surpluses and doubled our investment in education. We cut crime with 100,000 community police and the Brady law, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals. \\n\\nWe ended welfare as we knew it, requiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children and investing more in child care, transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We\\'ve helped parents to succeed at home and at work with family leave, which 20 million Americans have now used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one. We\\'ve engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through AmeriCorps, while helping them earn money for college. \\n\\nIn 1992, we just had a roadmap. Today, we have results. \\n\\nEven more important, America again has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not let this confidence drift into complacency. For we, all of us, will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed, because our chance to do good is so great. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century. Now, we must shape a 21st century American revolution of opportunity, responsibility, and community. We must be now, as we were in the beginning, a new nation. \\n\\nAt the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, \"The one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight . . . it should be the growing Nation with a future that takes the long look ahead.\" So tonight let us take our long look ahead and set great goals for our Nation. \\n\\nTo 21st century America, let us pledge these things: Every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work, and no child will be raised in poverty. We will meet the challenge of the aging of America. We will assure quality, affordable health care, at last, for all Americans. We will make America the safest big country on Earth. We will pay off our national debt for the first time since 1835.* We will bring prosperity to every American community. We will reverse the course of climate change and leave a safer, cleaner planet. America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology. And we will become at last what our Founders pledged us to be so long ago: One Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. \\n\\nThese are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them all this year, not even in this decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember that the first American Revolution was not won with a single shot; the continent was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history and the lesson of the last 7 years is that great goals are reached step by step, always building on our progress, always gaining ground. \\n\\nOf course, you can\\'t gain ground if you\\'re standing still. And for too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities. So let\\'s begin tonight with them. \\n\\nAgain, I ask you to pass a real Patients\\' Bill of Rights. I ask you to pass commonsense gun safety legislation. I ask you to pass campaign finance reform. I ask you to vote up or down on judicial nominations and other important appointees. And again, I ask you&mdash;I implore you to raise the minimum wage. \\n\\nNow, 2 years ago&mdash;let me try to balance the seesaw here&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;2 years ago, as we reached across party lines to reach our first balanced budget, I asked that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal discipline. Because we refused to stray from that path, we are doing something that would have seemed unimaginable 7 years ago. We are actually paying down the national debt. Now, if we stay on this path, we can pay down the debt entirely in just 13 years now and make America debt-free for the first time since Andrew Jackson was President in 1835. \\n\\nIn 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you\\'ll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom. He\\'s here with us tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you. \\n\\nBeyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every American, Social Security and Medicare. Tonight I ask you to work with me to make a bipartisan downpayment on Social Security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security Trust Fund so that it will be strong and sound for the next 50 years. \\n\\nBut this is just the start of our journey. We must also take the right steps toward reaching our great goals. First and foremost, we need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our faith that every single child can learn. Because education is more important than ever, more than ever the key to our children\\'s future, we must make sure all our children have that key. That means quality preschool and afterschool, the best trained teachers in the classroom, and college opportunities for all our children. \\n\\nFor 7 years now, we\\'ve worked hard to improve our schools, with opportunity and responsibility, investing more but demanding more in turn. Reading, math, college entrance scores are up. Some of the most impressive gains are in schools in very poor neighborhoods. \\n\\nBut all successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher standards, more accountability, and extra help so children who need it can get it to reach those standards. I have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. It holds States and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results. Each year, our National Government invests more than $15 billion in our schools. It is time to support what works and stop supporting what doesn\\'t. \\n\\nNow, as we demand more from our schools, we should also invest more in our schools. Let\\'s double our investment to help States and districts turn around their worst performing schools or shut them down. Let\\'s double our investments in after-school and summer school programs, which boost achievement and keep people off the streets and out of trouble. If we do this, we can give every single child in every failing school in America&mdash;everyone&mdash;the chance to meet high standards. \\n\\nSince 1993, we\\'ve nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and improved its quality. Tonight I ask you for another $1 billion for Head Start, the largest increase in the history of the program. \\n\\nWe know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers. For 2 years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to hire 100,000 new qualified teachers to lower class size in the early grades. I thank you for that, and I ask you to make it 3 in a row. And to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I propose a new teacher quality initiative, to recruit more talented people into the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and give all teachers the training they need. \\n\\nWe know charter schools provide real public school choice. When I became President, there was just one independent public charter school in all America. Today, thanks to you, there are 1,700. I ask you now to help us meet our goal of 3,000 charter schools by next year. \\n\\nWe know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet, and we\\'re getting there. In 1994, only 3 percent of our classrooms were connected. Today, with the help of the Vice President\\'s E-rate program, more than half of them are, and 90 percent of our schools have at least one Internet connection. But we cannot finish the job when a third of all our schools are in serious disrepair. Many of them have walls and wires so old, they\\'re too old for the Internet. So tonight I propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate and urgent repairs and, again, to help build or modernize 6,000 more, to get students out of trailers and into high-tech classrooms. \\n\\nI ask all of you to help me double our bipartisan GEAR UP program, which provides mentors for disadvantaged young people. If we double it, we can provide mentors for 1.4 million of them. Let\\'s also offer these kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the same chance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students use to boost their test scores. \\n\\nTo make the American dream achievable for all, we must make college affordable for all. For 7 years, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken action toward that goal: larger Pell grants, more affordable student loans, education IRA\\'s, and our HOPE scholarships, which have already benefited 5 million young people. \\n\\nNow, 67 percent of high school graduates are going on to college. That\\'s up 10 percent since 1993. Yet millions of families still strain to pay college tuition. They need help. So I propose a landmark $30 billion college opportunity tax cut, a middle class tax deduction for up to $10,000 in college tuition costs. The previous actions of this Congress have already made 2 years of college affordable for all. It\\'s time make 4 years of college affordable for all. If we take all these steps, we\\'ll move a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed. \\n\\nWe also need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen families by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most important work of all, raising children. That means making sure every family has health care and the support to care for aging parents, the tools to bring their children up right, and that no child grows up in poverty. \\n\\nFrom my first days as President, we\\'ve worked to give families better access to better health care. In 1997, we passed the Children\\'s Health Insurance Program&mdash;CHIP&mdash;so that workers who don\\'t have coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children. So far, we\\'ve enrolled 2 million children. We\\'re well on our way to our goal of 5 million. \\n\\nBut there are still more than 40 million of our fellow Americans without health insurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight I propose that we follow Vice President Gore\\'s suggestion to make low income parents eligible for the insurance that covers their children. Together with our children\\'s initiative&mdash;think of this&mdash;together with our children\\'s initiative, this action would enable us to cover nearly a quarter of all the uninsured people in America. \\n\\nAgain, I want to ask you to let people between the ages of 55 and 65, the fastest growing group of uninsured, buy into Medicare. And this year I propose to give them a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one. I hope you will support that, as well. \\n\\nWhen the baby boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for twice as many of our citizens; yet, it is far from ready to do so. My generation must not ask our children\\'s generation to shoulder our burden. We simply must act now to strengthen and modernize Medicare. \\n\\nMy budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it more efficient and more competitive. And it dedicates nearly $400 billion of our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025. And at long last, it also provides funds to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drugs. \\n\\nLifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one creating a Medicare program today would even think of excluding coverage for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five of our seniors now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives. Millions of older Americans, who need prescription drugs the most, pay the highest prices for them. In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to all our seniors this lifeline of affordable prescription drugs. \\n\\nRecord numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home. It\\'s a loving but a difficult and often very expensive choice. Last year, I proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care. Frankly, it wasn\\'t enough. This year, let\\'s triple it to $3,000. But this year, let\\'s pass it. \\n\\nWe also have to make needed investments to expand access to mental health care. I want to take a moment to thank the person who led our first White House Conference on Mental Health last year and who for 7 years has led all our efforts to break down the barriers to decent treatment of people with mental illness. Thank you, Tipper Gore. \\n\\nTaken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in health care in the 35 years since Medicare was created&mdash;the largest investment in 35 years. That would be a big step toward assuring quality health care for all Americans, young and old. And I ask you to embrace them and pass them. \\n\\nWe must also make investments that reward work and support families. Nothing does that better than the earned-income tax credit, the EITC. The \"E\" in the EITC is about earning, working, taking responsibility, and being rewarded for it. In my very first address to you, I asked Congress to greatly expand this credit, and you did. As a result, in 1998 alone, the EITC helped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way out of poverty toward the middle class. That\\'s double the number in 1993. \\n\\nTonight I propose another major expansion of the EITC: to reduce the marriage penalty, to make sure it rewards marriage as it rewards work, and also to expand the tax credit for families that have more than two children. It punishes people with more than two children today. Our proposal would allow families with three or more children to get up to $1,100 more in tax relief. These are working families; their children should not be in poverty. \\n\\nWe also can\\'t reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for equal work. Today the female unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 46 years. Yet, women still only earn about 75 cents for every dollar men earn. We must do better, by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws, training more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing the \"Paycheck Fairness Act.\" \\n\\nMany working parents spend up to a quarter&mdash;a quarter&mdash;of their income on child care. Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about 2 million children. My child care initiative before you now, along with funds already secured in welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more affordable for another 400,000 children. I ask you to pass that. They need it out there. \\n\\nFor hard-pressed middle income families, we should also expand the child care tax credit. And I believe strongly we should take the next big step and make that tax credit refundable for low income families. For people making under $30,000 a year, that could mean up to $2,400 for child care costs. You know, we all say we\\'re pro-work and pro-family. Passing this proposal would prove it. \\n\\nTen of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard as they work, they still don\\'t have the opportunity to save. Too few can make use of IRA\\'s and 401k plans. We should do more to help all working families save and accumulate wealth. That\\'s the idea behind the Individual Development Accounts, the IDA\\'s. I ask you to take that idea to a new level, with new retirement savings accounts that enable every low and moderate income family in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical emergency, or a college education. I propose to match their contributions, however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save. And I propose to give a major new tax credit to any small business that will provide a meaningful pension to its workers. Those people ought to have retirement as well as the rest of us. \\n\\nNearly one in three American children grows up without a father. These children are 5 times more likely to live in poverty than children with both parents at home. Clearly, demanding and supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all our children out of poverty. We\\'ve doubled child support collections since 1992. And I\\'m proposing to you tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible. \\n\\nBut we should recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their children but need help to do it. Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minnesota, wanted to do right by his son, and he got the help to do it. Now he\\'s got a good job, and he supports his little boy. My budget will help 40,000 more fathers make the same choices Carlos Rosas did. I thank him for being here tonight. Stand up, Carlos. [Applause] Thank you. \\n\\nIf there is any single issue on which we should be able to reach across party lines, it is in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Just remember what we did last year. We came together to help people with disabilities keep their health insurance when they go to work. And I thank you for that. Thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved foster care. We\\'ve helped those young people who leave it when they turn 18, and we have dramatically increased the number of foster care children going into adoptive homes. I thank all of you for all of that. \\n\\nOf course, I am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning and who\\'s worked so tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now, my wife, Hillary, and I thank her. \\n\\nIf we take the steps just discussed, we can go a long, long way toward empowering parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised in poverty. We can make these vital investments in health care, education, support for working families, and still offer tax cuts to help pay for college, for retirement, to care for aging parents, to reduce the marriage penalty. We can do these things without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us to this point here tonight. Indeed, we must make these investments and these tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the national debt. \\n\\nCrime in America has dropped for the past 7 years&mdash;that\\'s the longest decline on record&mdash; thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention. But nobody, nobody here, nobody in America believes we\\'re safe enough. So again, I ask you to set a higher goal. Let\\'s make this country the safest big country in the world. \\n\\nLast fall, Congress supported my plan to hire, in addition to the 100,000 community police we\\'ve already funded, 50,000 more, concentrated in high-crime neighborhoods. I ask your continued support for that. \\n\\nSoon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered commonsense gun legislation, to require Brady background checks at the gun shows, child safety locks for new handguns, and a ban on the importation of large capacity ammunition clips. With courage and a tie-breaking vote by the Vice President&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood up for the American people, and passed this legislation. But the House failed to follow suit. \\n\\nNow, we have all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands. Daniel Mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at Columbine. He was an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. Like all parents who lose their children, his father, Tom, has borne unimaginable grief. Somehow he has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into action. Earlier this month, he took a leave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws. I pray that his courage and wisdom will at long last move this Congress to make commonsense gun legislation the very next order of business. Tom Mauser, stand up. We thank you for being here tonight. Tom. Thank you, Tom. [Applause] \\n\\nWe must strengthen our gun laws and enforce those already on the books better. Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office. But we must do more. I propose to hire more Federal and local gun prosecutors and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and bad-apple dealers. And we must give them the enforcement tools that they need, tools to trace every gun and every bullet used in every gun crime in the United States. I ask you to help us do that. \\n\\nEvery State in this country already requires hunters and automobile drivers to have a license. I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases. Now, specifically, I propose a plan to ensure that all new handgun buyers must first have a photo license from their State showing they passed the Brady background check and a gun safety course, before they get the gun. I hope you\\'ll help me pass that in this Congress. \\n\\nListen to this&mdash;listen to this. The accidental gun rate&mdash;the accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the United States is 9 times higher than in the other 25 industrialized countries combined. Now, technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them. I ask Congress to fund research into smart gun technology to save these children\\'s lives. I ask responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands, to keep our children safe. \\n\\nYou know, every parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media on their children. I want to begin by thanking the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet games. But frankly, the ratings are too numerous, diverse, and confusing to be really useful to parents. So tonight I ask the industry to accept the First Lady\\'s challenge to develop a single voluntary rating system for all children\\'s entertainment that is easier for parents to understand and enforce. \\n\\nThe steps I outline will take us well on our way to making America the safest big country in the world. \\n\\nNow, to keep our historic economic expansion going, the subject of a lot of discussion in this community and others, I believe we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets, start new businesses, hire new workers right here in America, in our inner cities, poor rural areas, and Native American reservations. \\n\\nOur Nation\\'s prosperity hasn\\'t yet reached these places. Over the last 6 months, I\\'ve traveled to a lot of them, joined by many of you and many far-sighted business people, to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from Watts to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Everywhere I go, I meet talented people eager for opportunity and able to work. Tonight I ask you, let\\'s put them to work. For business, it\\'s the smart thing to do. For America, it\\'s the right thing to do. And let me ask you something: If we don\\'t do this now, when in the wide world will we ever get around to it? \\n\\nSo I ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in America\\'s new markets they now have to invest in markets overseas. Tonight I propose a large new markets tax credit and other incentives to spur $22 billion in private-sector capital to create new businesses and new investments in our inner cities and rural areas. Because empowerment zones have been creating these opportunities for 5 years now, I also ask you to increase incentives to invest in them and to create more of them. \\n\\nAnd let me say to all of you again what I have tried to say at every turn: This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. Giving people a chance to live their dreams is an American issue. \\n\\nMr. Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you joined Reverend Jesse Jackson and me in your home State of Illinois and committed to working toward our common goal by combining the best ideas from both sides of the aisle. I want to thank you again and to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with you. This is a worthy joint endeavor. Thank you. \\n\\nI also ask you to make special efforts to address the areas of our Nation with the highest rates of poverty, our Native American reservations and the Mississippi Delta. My budget includes a $110 million initiative to promote economic development in the Delta and a billion dollars to increase economic opportunity, health care, education, and law enforcement for our Native American communities. We should begin this new century by honoring our historic responsibility to empower the first Americans. And I want to thank tonight the leaders and the members from both parties who\\'ve expressed to me an interest in working with us on these efforts. They are profoundly important. \\n\\nThere\\'s another part of our American community in trouble tonight, our family farmers. When I signed the farm bill in 1996, I said there was great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad. Well, droughts, floods, and historically low prices have made these times very bad for the farmers. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety net, invest in land conservation, and create some new markets for them by expanding our programs for bio-based fuels and products. Please, they need help. Let\\'s do it together. \\n\\nOpportunity for all requires something else today, having access to a computer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the digital divide between those who\\'ve got the tools and those who don\\'t. Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it\\'s just a start. My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach 21st century skills, and it creates technology centers in 1,000 communities to serve adults. This spring, I\\'ll invite high-tech leaders to join me on another new markets tour, to close the digital divide and open opportunity for our people. I want to thank the high-tech companies that already are doing so much in this area. I hope the new tax incentives I have proposed will get all the rest of them to join us. This is a national crusade. We have got to do this and do it quickly. \\n\\nNow, again I say to you, these are steps, but step by step, we can go a long way toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community. \\n\\nTo realize the full possibilities of this economy, we must reach beyond our own borders to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals and economies and cultures: globalization. It\\'s the central reality of our time. \\n\\nOf course, change this profound is both liberating and threatening to people. But there\\'s no turning back. And our open, creative society stands to benefit more than any other if we understand and act on the realities of interdependence. We have to be at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and a good partner. We have to recognize that we cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs. \\n\\nThe first thing we have got to do is to forge a new consensus on trade. Now, those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade, we have to ensure that it lifts both our living standards and our values, never tolerating abusive child labor or a race to the bottom in the environment and worker protection. But others must recognize that open markets and rule-based trade are the best engines we know of for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas. \\n\\nI believe, as strongly tonight as I did the first day I got here, the only direction forward for America on trade&mdash;the only direction for America on trade is to keep going forward. I ask you to help me forge that consensus. We have to make developing economies our partners in prosperity. That\\'s why I would like to ask you again to finalize our groundbreaking African and Caribbean Basin trade initiatives. \\n\\nBut globalization is about more than economics. Our purpose must be to bring together the world around freedom and democracy and peace and to oppose those who would tear it apart. Here are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to shape the 21st century world. \\n\\nFirst, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia and China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations. Both are being held back today from reaching their full potential: Russia by the legacy of communism, an economy in turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom. \\n\\nBut think how much has changed in the past decade: 5,000 former Soviet nuclear weapons taken out of commission; Russian soldiers actually serving with ours in the Balkans; Russian people electing their leaders for the first time in 1,000 years; and in China, an economy more open to the world than ever before. \\n\\nOf course, no one, not a single person in this Chamber tonight can know for sure what direction these great nations will take. But we do know for sure that we can choose what we do. And we should do everything in our power to increase the chance that they will choose wisely, to be constructive members of our global community. \\n\\nThat\\'s why we should support those Russians who are struggling for a democratic, prosperous future; continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals; and help Russia to safeguard weapons and materials that remain. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I believe Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring China into the WTO, by passing permanent normal trade relations with China as soon as possible this year. I think you ought to do it for two reasons: First of all, our markets are already open to China; this agreement will open China\\'s markets to us. And second, it will plainly advance the cause of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China. No, we don\\'t know where it\\'s going. All we can do is decide what we\\'re going to do. But when all is said and done, we need to know we did everything we possibly could to maximize the chance that China will choose the right future. \\n\\nA second challenge we\\'ve got is to protect our own security from conflicts that pose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. We can\\'t prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference, we should be, and we must be, peacemakers. \\n\\nWe should be proud of our role in bringing the Middle East closer to a lasting peace, building peace in Northern Ireland, working for peace in East Timor and Africa, promoting reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus, working to defuse these crises between India and Pakistan, in defending human rights and religious freedom. And we should be proud of the men and women of our Armed Forces and those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, enabling a million people to return to their homes. \\n\\nWhen Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Captain John Cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when another American plane was shot down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our Armed Forces\\' skill and bravery, we prevailed in Kosovo without losing a single American in combat. I want to introduce Captain Cherrey to you. We honor Captain Cherrey, and we promise you, Captain, we\\'ll finish the job you began. Stand up so we can see you. [Applause] \\n\\nA third challenge we have is to keep this inexorable march of technology from giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our defenses. Keep in mind, the same technological advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use. \\n\\nWe must meet this threat by making effective agreements to restrain nuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow of lethal technology to Iran, preventing Iraq from threatening its neighbors, increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack, protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals, and developing a system to defend against new missile threats, while working to preserve our ABM missile treaty with Russia. We must do all these things. \\n\\nI predict to you, when most of us are long gone but some time in the next 10 to 20 years, the major security threat this country will face will come from the enemies of the nation-state, the narcotraffickers and the terrorists and the organized criminals who will be organized together, working together, with increasing access to ever more sophisticated chemical and biological weapons. And I want to thank the Pentagon and others for doing what they\\'re doing right now to try to help protect us and plan for that, so that our defenses will be strong. I ask for your support to ensure they can succeed. \\n\\nI also want to ask you for a constructive bipartisan dialog this year to work to build a consensus which I hope will eventually lead to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \\n\\nI hope we can also have a constructive effort to meet the challenge that is presented to our planet by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept a world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy and the rest live on the bare edge of survival. I think we have to do our part to change that with expanded trade, expanded aid, and the expansion of freedom. \\n\\nThis is interesting: From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people got the right to choose their leaders in 1999 than in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. We\\'ve got to stand by these democracies, including and especially tonight Colombia, which is fighting narcotraffickers, for its own people\\'s lives and our children\\'s lives. I have proposed a strong 2-year package to help Colombia win this fight. I want to thank the leaders in both parties in both Houses for listening to me and the President of Colombia about it. We have got to pass this. I want to ask your help. A lot is riding on it. And it\\'s so important for the long-term stability of our country and for what happens in Latin America. \\n\\nI also want you to know I\\'m going to send you new legislation to go after what these drug barons value the most, their money. And I hope you\\'ll pass that as well. \\n\\nIn a world where over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we also have got to do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries, so they can invest in education, health care, and economic growth. That\\'s what the Pope and other religious leaders have urged us to do. And last year, Congress made a downpayment on America\\'s share. I ask you to continue that. I thank you for what you did and ask you to stay the course. \\n\\nI also want to say that America must help more nations to break the bonds of disease. Last year in Africa, 10 times as many people died from AIDS as were killed in wars&mdash;10 times. The budget I give you invests $150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers. And today I propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for diseases like malaria, TB, and AIDS. I ask the private sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this cause. We can save millions of lives together, and we ought to do it. \\n\\nI also want to mention our final challenge, which, as always, is the most important. I ask you to pass a national security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the world, with heightened readiness and 21st century weapons, which raises salaries for our service men and women, which protects our veterans, which fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war, which makes good on our commitment to our U.N. dues and arrears. I ask you to pass this budget. \\n\\nI also want to say something, if I might, very personal tonight. The American people watching us at home, with the help of all the commentators, can tell, from who stands and who sits and who claps and who doesn\\'t, that there\\'s still modest differences of opinion in this room. [Laughter] But I want to thank you for something, every one of you. I want to thank you for the extraordinary support you have given, Republicans and Democrats alike, to our men and women in uniform. I thank you for that. \\n\\nI also want to thank, especially, two people. First, I want to thank our Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to national security. Thank you, sir. Even more, I want to thank his wife, Janet, who, more than any other American citizen, has tirelessly traveled this world to show the support we all feel for our troops. Thank you, Janet Cohen. I appreciate that. Thank you. \\n\\nThese are the challenges we have to meet so that we can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization. \\n\\nI want to tell you that I am very grateful for many things as President. But one of the things I\\'m grateful for is the opportunity that the Vice President and I have had to finally put to rest the bogus idea that you cannot grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time. \\n\\nAs our economy has grown, we\\'ve rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste, ensured cleaner air and water for millions of people. In the past 3 months alone, we\\'ve helped preserve 40 million acres of roadless lands in the national forests, created three new national monuments. \\n\\nBut as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must continue to grow. Tonight I propose creating a permanent conservation fund, to restore wildlife, protect coastlines, save natural treasures, from the California redwoods to the Florida Everglades. This lands legacy endowment would represent by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed in this House. I hope we can get together with all the people with different ideas and do this. This is a gift we should give to our children and our grandchildren for all time, across party lines. We can make an agreement to do this. \\n\\nLast year the Vice President launched a new effort to make communities more liberal&mdash;livable&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;liberal, I know. [Laughter] Wait a minute, I\\'ve got a punchline now. That\\'s this year\\'s agenda; last year was livable, right? [Laughter] That\\'s what Senator Lott is going to say in the commentary afterwards&mdash;[laughter]&mdash;to make our communities more livable. This is big business. This is a big issue. What does that mean? You ask anybody that lives in an unlivable community, and they\\'ll tell you. They want their kids to grow up next to parks, not parking lots; the parents don\\'t have to spend all their time stalled in traffic when they could be home with their children. \\n\\nTonight I ask you to support new funding for the following things, to make American communities more liberal&mdash;livable. [Laughter] I\\'ve done pretty well with this speech, but I can\\'t say that. \\n\\nOne, I want you to help us to do three things. We need more funding for advanced transit systems. We need more funding for saving open spaces in places of heavy development. And we need more funding&mdash;this ought to have bipartisan appeal&mdash;we need more funding for helping major cities around the Great Lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life. We need these things, and I want you to help us. \\n\\nThe greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming. The scientists tell us the 1990\\'s were the hottest decade of the entire millennium. If we fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will flood, and economies will be disrupted. That is going to happen, unless we act. \\n\\nMany people in the United States, some people in this Chamber, and lots of folks around the world still believe you cannot cut greenhouse gas emissions without slowing economic growth. In the industrial age, that may well have been true. But in this digital economy, it is not true anymore. New technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even more growth. \\n\\nFor example, just last week, automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon, the fruits of a unique research partnership between Government and industry. And before you know it, efficient production of bio-fuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gasoline. \\n\\nTo speed innovation in these kind of technologies, I think we should give a major tax incentive to business for the production of clean energy and to families for buying energy-saving homes and appliances and the next generation of superefficient cars when they hit the showroom floor. I also ask the auto industry to use the available technologies to make all new cars more fuel-efficient right away. \\n\\nAnd I ask this Congress to do something else. Please help us make more of our clean energy technology available to the developing world. That will create cleaner growth abroad and a lot more new jobs here in the United States of America. \\n\\nIn the new century, innovations in science and technology will be key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy. Later this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the entire human genome, the very blueprint of life. It is important for all our fellow Americans to recognize that Federal tax dollars have funded much of this research and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease. \\n\\nFor example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson\\'s, diabetes, and certain kinds of cancer. They are designing precision therapies that will block the harmful effect of these genes for good. Researchers already are using this new technique to target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer\\'s. Scientists are also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see and&mdash;listen to this&mdash;microchips that would actually directly stimulate damaged spinal cords in a way that could allow people now paralyzed to stand up and walk. \\n\\nThese kinds of innovations are also propelling our remarkable prosperity. Information technology only includes 8 percent of our employment but now accounts for a third of our economic growth along with jobs that pay, by the way, about 80 percent above the private sector average. Again, we ought to keep in mind, Government-funded research brought supercomputers, the Internet, and communications satellites into being. Soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can talk, materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight, and&mdash; this is unbelievable to me&mdash;molecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power of today\\'s fastest supercomputers. \\n\\nTo accelerate the march of discovery across all these disciplines in science and technology, I ask you to support my recommendation of an unprecedented $3 billion in the 21st century research fund, the largest increase in civilian research in a generation. We owe it to our future. \\n\\nNow, these new breakthroughs have to be used in ways that reflect our values. First and foremost, we have to safeguard our citizens\\' privacy. Last year we proposed to protect every citizen\\'s medical record. This year we will finalize those rules. We\\'ve also taken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card records and other financial statements. Soon I will send legislation to you to finish that job. We must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination whatever by employers or insurers. I hope you will support that. \\n\\nThese steps will allow us to lead toward the far frontiers of science and technology. They will enhance our health, the environment, the economy in ways we can\\'t even imagine today. But we all know that at a time when science, technology, and the forces of globalization are bringing so many changes into all our lives, it\\'s more important than ever that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in our national community. \\n\\nNo tie binds different people together like citizen service. There\\'s a new spirit of service in America, a movement we\\'ve tried to support with AmeriCorps, expanded Peace Corps, unprecedented new partnerships with businesses, foundations, community groups; partnerships, for example, like the one that enlisted 12,000 companies which have now moved 650,000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to work; partnerships to battle drug abuse, AIDS, teach young people to read, save America\\'s treasures, strengthen the arts, fight teen pregnancy, prevent violence among young people, promote racial healing. The American people are working together. \\n\\nBut we should do more to help Americans help each other. First, we should help faithbased organizations to do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help people get back on the right track, with initiatives like Second Chance Homes that do so much to help unwed teen mothers. Second, we should support Americans who tithe and contribute to charities but don\\'t earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it. Tonight I propose new tax incentives that would allow low and middle income citizens who don\\'t itemize to get that deduction. It\\'s nothing but fair, and it will get more people to give. \\n\\nWe should do more to help new immigrants to fully participate in our community. That\\'s why I recommend spending more to teach them civics and English. And since everybody in our community counts, we\\'ve got to make sure everyone is counted in this year\\'s census. \\n\\nWithin 10 years&mdash;just 10 years&mdash;there will be no majority race in our largest State of California. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race in America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our greatest strength. Just look around this Chamber. Look around. We have Members in this Congress from virtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background. And I think you would agree that America is stronger because of it. [Applause] \\n\\nYou also have to agree that all those differences you just clapped for all too often spark hatred and division even here at home. Just in the last couple of years, we\\'ve seen a man dragged to death in Texas just because he was black. We saw a young man murdered in Wyoming just because he was gay. Last year we saw the shootings of African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Jewish children just because of who they were. This is not the American way, and we must draw the line. \\n\\nI ask you to draw that line by passing without delay the \"Hate Crimes Prevention Act\" and the \"Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\" And I ask you to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. \\n\\nFinally tonight, I propose the largest ever investment in our civil rights laws for enforcement, because no American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home, getting a job, going to school, or securing a loan. Protections in law should be protections in fact. \\n\\nLast February, because I thought this was so important, I created the White House Office of One America to promote racial reconciliation. That\\'s what one of my personal heroes, Hank Aaron, has done all his life. From his days as our all-time home run king to his recent acts of healing, he has always brought people together. We should follow his example, and we\\'re honored to have him with us tonight. Stand up, Hank Aaron. [Applause] \\n\\nI just want to say one more thing about this, and I want every one of you to think about this the next time you get mad at one of your colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This fall, at the White House, Hillary had one of her millennium dinners, and we had this very distinguished scientist there, who is an expert in this whole work in the human genome. And he said that we are all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9 percent the same. \\n\\nNow, you may find that uncomfortable when you look around here. [Laughter] But it is worth remembering. We can laugh about this, but you think about it. Modern science has confirmed what ancient faiths have always taught: the most important fact of life is our common humanity. Therefore, we should do more than just tolerate our diversity; we should honor it and celebrate it. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans, every time I prepare for the State of the Union, I approach it with hope and expectation and excitement for our Nation. But tonight is very special, because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium. Behind us we can look back and see the great expanse of American achievement, and before us we can see even greater, grander frontiers of possibility. We should, all of us, be filled with gratitude and humility for our present progress and prosperity. We should be filled with awe and joy at what lies over the horizon. And we should be filled with absolute determination to make the most of it. \\n\\nYou know, when the Framers finished crafting our Constitution in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin stood in Independence Hall, and he reflected on the carving of the Sun that was on the back of a chair he saw. The Sun was low on the horizon. So he said this&mdash;he said, \"I\\'ve often wondered whether that Sun was rising or setting. Today,\" Franklin said, \"I have the happiness to know it\\'s a rising Sun.\" Today, because each succeeding generation of Americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers of possibility, we all still bask in the glow and the warmth of Mr. Franklin\\'s rising Sun. \\n\\nAfter 224 years, the American revolution continues. We remain a new nation. And as long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be forever young. That is our destiny. And this is our moment. \\n\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.'"

       "u'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\\n\\nLess than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.\\n\\nEach day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission -- to make America great again for all Americans. (Applause.)\\n\\nOver the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America\\'s soul, and the steel in America\\'s spine.\\n\\nEach test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.\\n\\nWe saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane.\\n\\nWe saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\\n\\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania. (Applause.) Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.) \\n\\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He\\'s here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires.\\n\\nTo everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands -- everywhere -- we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. (Applause.) \\n\\nThank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very much, David. Great job. \\n\\nSome trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. (Applause.) I think they like you, Steve. (Laughter.) \\n\\nWe are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath -- (applause) -- yes. Yes.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve. (Applause.) \\n\\nOver the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there\\'s a challenge, we tame it. If there\\'s an opportunity, we seize it.\\n\\nSo let\\'s begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. (Applause.) And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.\\n\\nSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including -- (applause) -- including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers. (Applause.) After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. (Applause.) \\n\\nUnemployment claims have hit a 45-year low. (Applause.) It\\'s something I\\'m very proud of. African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded. (Applause.) And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. (Applause.) \\n\\nSmall-business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion, and more, in value in just this short period of time. The great news -- (applause) -- the great news for Americans\\' 401(k), retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.\\n\\nAnd just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. (Applause.) \\n\\nOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone. (Applause.) Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free. (Applause.) We also doubled the child tax credit. (Applause.) A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half. (Applause.) \\n\\nIn April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system, and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month -- a lot more. (Applause.) \\n\\nWe eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn\\'t afford government-ordered health plans. (Applause.) We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone. Thank heaven. (Applause.) \\n\\nWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world. (Applause.) These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money. (Applause.) \\n\\nSmall businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.\\n\\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They\\'ve just finished the best year in their 20-year history. (Applause.) Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. Good feeling. (Applause.) \\n\\nOne of Staub\\'s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax?cut raise into his new home and his two daughters\\' education. Corey, please stand. (Applause.) And he\\'s a great welder. (Laughter.) I was told that by the man that owns that company that\\'s doing so well. So congratulations, Corey. \\n\\nSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it\\'s getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. (Applause.) And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States, just a little while ago. (Applause.) \\n\\nThis, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.\\n\\nSo to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you\\'ve been, or where you\\'ve come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything. (Applause.) \\n\\nTonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything.\\n\\nWe all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. (Applause.) \\n\\nTogether, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is, \"In God We Trust.\" (Applause.) \\n\\nAnd we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. (Applause.)\\n\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans\\' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes. (Applause.) Preston, a job well done. (Applause.) \\n\\nYoung patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special -- that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all you\\'ve done, Preston. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\\n\\nPreston\\'s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the National Anthem. (Applause.)\\n\\nAmericans love their country, and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government.\\n\\nWorking with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe are totally defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions. (Applause.) Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act. (Applause.) Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. (Applause.) \\n\\nAnd I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey. (Applause.) \\n\\nAll Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that\\'s what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you. (Applause.) \\n\\nSo, tonight, I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people. (Applause.)\\n\\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal. (Applause.) We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world. (Applause.) \\n\\nIn Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America\\'s great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again. And that\\'s what\\'s happening. (Applause.) Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States -- something we haven\\'t seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama -- a big one. And we haven\\'t seen this in a long time. It\\'s all coming back. (Applause.)\\n\\nVery soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country. This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They\\'re coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. That\\'s where they want to be. (Applause.)\\n\\nExciting progress is happening every single day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country\\'s history. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe also believe that patients with terminal conditions, and terminal illness, should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives.\\n\\nPeople who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It\\'s time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. (Applause.)\\n\\nOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs. (Applause.) In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it\\'s very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year. (Applause.) And prices will come down substantially. Watch.\\n\\nAmerica has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our nation has lost its wealth, but we\\'re getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they\\'ll be good ones, but they\\'ll be fair. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. (Applause.)\\n\\nAmerica is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn\\'t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road? (Applause.) I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve. (Applause.)\\n\\nTonight, I\\'m calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it. (Applause.)\\n\\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage. (Applause.) \\n\\nWe will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart, and American hands, and American grit. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe want every American to know the dignity of a hard day\\'s work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let\\'s invest in workforce development and let\\'s invest in job training, which we need so badly. (Applause.) Let\\'s open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential. (Applause.) And let\\'s support working families by supporting paid family leave. (Applause.) \\n\\nAs America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance at life. (Applause.) \\n\\nStruggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.\\n\\nFor decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They\\'ve allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. \\n\\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa\\'s 16th Birthday -- such a happy time it should have been -- neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. \\n\\nSix members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa\\'s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa\\'s high school. \\n\\nEvelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand. Thank you very much. (Applause.) I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you. (Applause.)\\n\\nWhile we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain.\\n\\nTonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents -- these are great people; these are great, great people -- that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again. (Applause.) \\n\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America\\'s children, America\\'s struggling workers, and America\\'s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.\\n\\nSo, tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. (Applause.) My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. (Applause.)\\n\\nHere tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \"DJ\" and \"CJ.\" He said, \"Call me either one.\" So we\\'ll call you \"CJ.\" Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. Tough job. \\n\\nAt one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ\\'s murder. And they wanted it to happen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang members.\\n\\nAnd I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done -- we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons. \\n\\nSo I just want to congratulate you, CJ. You\\'re a brave guy. Thank you very much. (Applause.) \\n\\nAnd I asked CJ, \"What\\'s the secret?\" He said, \"We\\'re just tougher than they are.\" And I like that answer. (Laughter and applause.) Now let\\'s get Congress to send you -- and all of the people in this great chamber have to do it; we have no choice. CJ, we\\'re going to send you reinforcements, and we\\'re going to send them to you quickly. It\\'s what you need. (Applause.) \\n\\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have. (Applause.) \\n\\nHere are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered. (Applause.) Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period. (Applause.)\\n\\nThe second pillar fully secures the border. (Applause.) That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like CJ, to keep our communities safe. (Applause.) Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release. (Applause.)\\n\\nThe third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people. (Applause.) It\\'s time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. (Applause.)\\n\\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration. (Applause.) Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. (Applause.) This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford. (Applause.) \\n\\nIt\\'s time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. (Applause.)\\n\\nThese four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.\\n\\nFor over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\\n\\nMost importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first. (Applause.) So let\\'s come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. (Applause.)\\n\\nThese reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses -- 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. (Applause.)\\n\\nMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. The struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do -- in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He\\'s here tonight with his wife Rebecca. (Applause.) Thank you, Ryan. \\n\\nLast year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn\\'t know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\\n\\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \"You will do it, because you can.\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our nation. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca.\\n\\nAs we rebuild America\\'s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.\\n\\nAround the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.\\n\\nFor this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else. (Applause.) \\n\\nPerhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly. \\n\\nLast year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations, as well. (Applause.) But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.\\n\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon, and hopefully safely. \\n\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport, and maintained artificial respiration through two and a half hours and through emergency surgery.\\n\\nKenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin\\'s selfless love for his fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \"V\" for \"valor.\" Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you. (Applause.)\\n\\nTerrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants. (Applause.) And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. \\n\\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released.\\n\\nSo today, I\\'m keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis, who is doing a great job, thank you -- (applause) -- to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.)\\n\\nI am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay. (Applause.)\\n\\nAt the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement. (Applause.)\\n\\nAlong with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans. (Applause.) \\n\\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate just months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. (Applause.) \\n\\nShortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America\\'s sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid.\\n\\nThat is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America. (Applause.) \\n\\nAs we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.\\n\\nWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. (Applause.) \\n\\nI am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.\\n\\nMy administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. (Applause.) \\n\\nBut no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. North Korea\\'s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.\\n\\nPast experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.\\n\\nWe need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.\\n\\nOtto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia -- and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.\\n\\nOtto\\'s wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto\\'s brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please. (Applause.) Incredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)\\n\\nTonight, we pledge to honor Otto\\'s memory with total American resolve. Thank you. (Applause.) \\n\\nFinally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.\\n\\nIn 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth. \\n\\nLater, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he\\'d met any Christians. He had -- and he resolved, after that, to be free. \\n\\nSeong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.\\n\\nToday he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth.\\n\\nToday, he has a new leg. But, Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you\\'ve come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you. (Applause.) Seong-ho\\'s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.\\n\\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world.\\n\\nThat is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.\\n\\nAtop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought, and lived, and died to protect her. Monuments to Washington, and Jefferson, and Lincoln, and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia.\\n\\nAnd freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol -- this living monument -- this is the moment to the American people. (Applause.)\\n\\nWe\\'re a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.\\n\\nThey work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, and police officers, and border agents, medics, and Marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, this nation, belongs entirely to them. (Applause.)\\n\\nOur task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.\\n\\nAmericans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it\\'s the people who are making America great again. (Applause.)\\n\\nAs long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail.\\n\\nOur families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.\\n\\nThank you. And God bless America. Goodnight. (Applause.)'"

       "[u'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\\n\\nLess than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land.\\n\\nEach day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission -- to make America great again for all Americans. \\n\\nOver the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America\\'s soul, and the steel in America\\'s spine.\\n\\nEach test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be.\\n\\nWe saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy, racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane.\\n\\nWe saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip.\\n\\nWe heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania.  Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during the Hurricane Harvey. Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water to help save more than 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much.  \\n\\nWe heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He\\'s here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by those devastating wildfires.\\n\\nTo everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands -- everywhere -- we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always.  \\n\\nThank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very much, David. Great job. \\n\\nSome trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House -- a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later: the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise.  I think they like you, Steve.  \\n\\nWe are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others; some in this room. In the aftermath --  -- yes. Yes.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we were elected to serve.  \\n\\nOver the last year, the world has seen what we always knew: that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans. If there is a mountain, we climb it. If there is a frontier, we cross it. If there\\'s a challenge, we tame it. If there\\'s an opportunity, we seize it.\\n\\nSo let\\'s begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong.  And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America.\\n\\nSince the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including --  -- including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone. Tremendous numbers.  After years and years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages.  \\n\\nUnemployment claims have hit a 45-year low.  It\\'s something I\\'m very proud of. African American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded.  And Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history.  \\n\\nSmall-business confidence is at an all-time high. The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion, and more, in value in just this short period of time. The great news --  -- the great news for Americans\\' 401, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts have gone through the roof.\\n\\nAnd just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.  \\n\\nOur massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small business. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone.  Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free.  We also doubled the child tax credit.  A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000, slashing their tax bill in half.  \\n\\nIn April, this will be the last time you will ever file under the old and very broken system, and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month -- a lot more.  \\n\\nWe eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year, forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they couldn\\'t afford government-ordered health plans.  We repealed the core of the disastrous Obamacare. The individual mandate is now gone. Thank heaven.  \\n\\nWe slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone else anywhere in the world.  These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. A lot of money.  \\n\\nSmall businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income.\\n\\nHere tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing, a small, beautiful business in Ohio. They\\'ve just finished the best year in their 20-year history.  Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. Good feeling.  \\n\\nOne of Staub\\'s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight. Corey is an all-American worker. He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder. Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax?cut raise into his new home and his two daughters\\' education. Corey, please stand.  And he\\'s a great welder.  I was told that by the man that owns that company that\\'s doing so well. So congratulations, Corey. \\n\\nSince we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses -- many of them thousands and thousands of dollars per worker. And it\\'s getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers.  And just a little while ago, ExxonMobil announced a $50 billion investment in the United States, just a little while ago.  \\n\\nThis, in fact, is our new American moment. There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream.\\n\\nSo to every citizen watching at home tonight, no matter where you\\'ve been, or where you\\'ve come from, this is your time. If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve absolutely anything.  \\n\\nTonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of a nation we are going to be. All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family can do anything.\\n\\nWe all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag.  \\n\\nTogether, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of American life. The motto is, \"In God We Trust.\"  \\n\\nAnd we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. \\n\\nHere tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans\\' graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day. He decided all by himself to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes.  Preston, a job well done.  \\n\\nYoung patriots, like Preston, teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans. And I met Preston a little while ago, and he is something very special -- that I can tell you. Great future. Thank you very much for all you\\'ve done, Preston. Thank you very much. \\n\\nPreston\\'s reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us of why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the National Anthem. \\n\\nAmericans love their country, and they deserve a government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year, we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their government.\\n\\nWorking with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. \\n\\nWe are totally defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. \\n\\nAnd we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions.  Last year, Congress also passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act.  Since its passage, my administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve. And we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do.  \\n\\nAnd I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey.  \\n\\nAll Americans deserve accountability and respect, and that\\'s what we are giving to our wonderful heroes, our veterans. Thank you.  \\n\\nSo, tonight, I call on Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers and to remove federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people. \\n\\nIn our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in the history of our country. \\n\\nWe have ended the war on American energy, and we have ended the war on beautiful clean coal.  We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world.  \\n\\nIn Detroit, I halted government mandates that crippled America\\'s great, beautiful autoworkers so that we can get Motor City revving its engines again. And that\\'s what\\'s happening.  Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States -- something we haven\\'t seen for decades. Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan. Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama -- a big one. And we haven\\'t seen this in a long time. It\\'s all coming back. \\n\\nVery soon, auto plants and other plants will be opening up all over our country. This is all news Americans are totally unaccustomed to hearing. For many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us. But now they are roaring back. They\\'re coming back. They want to be where the action is. They want to be in the United States of America. That\\'s where they want to be. \\n\\nExciting progress is happening every single day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our country\\'s history. \\n\\nWe also believe that patients with terminal conditions, and terminal illness, should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives.\\n\\nPeople who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure. I want to give them a chance right here at home. It\\'s time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try. \\n\\nOne of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States. And it\\'s very, very unfair. That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of my top priorities for the year.  And prices will come down substantially. Watch.\\n\\nAmerica has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our wealth. Our nation has lost its wealth, but we\\'re getting it back so fast. The era of economic surrender is totally over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and, very importantly, reciprocal. \\n\\nWe will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And they\\'ll be good ones, but they\\'ll be fair. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property through strong enforcement of our trade rules. \\n\\nAs we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. \\n\\nAmerica is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn\\'t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?  I am asking both parties to come together to give us safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure that our economy needs and our people deserve. \\n\\nTonight, I\\'m calling on Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment that our country so desperately needs. Every federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. And we can do it. \\n\\nAny bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process, getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our great building heritage.  \\n\\nWe will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways all across our land. And we will do it with American heart, and American hands, and American grit. \\n\\nWe want every American to know the dignity of a hard day\\'s work. We want every child to be safe in their home at night. And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we all love so much. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. \\n\\nAs tax cuts create new jobs, let\\'s invest in workforce development and let\\'s invest in job training, which we need so badly.  Let\\'s open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.  And let\\'s support working families by supporting paid family leave.  \\n\\nAs America regains its strength, opportunity must be extended to all citizens. That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance at life.  \\n\\nStruggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families.\\n\\nFor decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities. They\\'ve allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans. Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. \\n\\nHere tonight are two fathers and two mothers: Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens. Their two teenage daughters -- Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens -- were close friends on Long Island. But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa\\'s 16th Birthday -- such a happy time it should have been -- neither of them came home. These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown. \\n\\nSix members of the savage MS-13 gang have been charged with Kayla and Nisa\\'s murders. Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as illegal, unaccompanied alien minors, and wound up in Kayla and Nisa\\'s high school. \\n\\nEvelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert: Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you. Everyone in America is grieving for you. Please stand. Thank you very much.  I want you to know that 320 million hearts are right now breaking for you. We love you. Thank you. \\n\\nWhile we cannot imagine the depths of that kind of sorrow, we can make sure that other families never have to endure this kind of pain.\\n\\nTonight, I am calling on Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminal gangs, to break into our country. We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws and support our ICE and Border Patrol agents -- these are great people; these are great, great people -- that work so hard in the midst of such danger so that this can never happen again.  \\n\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation. We are proud that we do more than any other country anywhere in the world to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world. But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, my constant concern is for America\\'s children, America\\'s struggling workers, and America\\'s forgotten communities. I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. I want our poor to have their chance to rise.\\n\\nSo, tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties, Democrats and Republicans, to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.  My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans, to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream. Because Americans are dreamers too. \\n\\nHere tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country, Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez. He goes by \"DJ\" and \"CJ.\" He said, \"Call me either one.\" So we\\'ll call you \"CJ.\" Served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off of our streets. Tough job. \\n\\nAt one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ\\'s murder. And they wanted it to happen quickly. But he did not cave to threats or to fear. Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island. His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 MS-13 gang members.\\n\\nAnd I have to tell you, what the Border Patrol and ICE have done -- we have sent thousands and thousands and thousands of MS-13 horrible people out of this country or into our prisons. \\n\\nSo I just want to congratulate you, CJ. You\\'re a brave guy. Thank you very much.  \\n\\nAnd I asked CJ, \"What\\'s the secret?\" He said, \"We\\'re just tougher than they are.\" And I like that answer.  Now let\\'s get Congress to send you -- and all of the people in this great chamber have to do it; we have no choice. CJ, we\\'re going to send you reinforcements, and we\\'re going to send them to you quickly. It\\'s what you need.  \\n\\nOver the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform. Based on these discussions, we presented Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise, one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs and must have.  \\n\\nHere are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age. That covers almost three times more people than the previous administration covered.  Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States over a 12-year period. \\n\\nThe second pillar fully secures the border.  That means building a great wall on the southern border, and it means hiring more heroes, like CJ, to keep our communities safe.  Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country, and it finally ends the horrible and dangerous practice of catch and release. \\n\\nThe third pillar ends the visa lottery, a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of American people.  It\\'s time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system, one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. \\n\\nThe fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.  Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.  This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security and for the future of America.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration. In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can just no longer afford.  \\n\\nIt\\'s time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. \\n\\nThese four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system.\\n\\nFor over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem. This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen.\\n\\nMost importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to sign a bill that puts America first.  So let\\'s come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. \\n\\nThese reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. Never before has it been like it is now. It is terrible. We have to do something about it. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses -- 174 deaths per day; 7 per hour. We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. \\n\\nMy administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need, for those who have been so terribly hurt. The struggle will be long and it will be difficult, but as Americans always do -- in the end, we will succeed. We will prevail. \\n\\nAs we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico. Ryan Holets is 27 years old, an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department. He\\'s here tonight with his wife Rebecca.  Thank you, Ryan. \\n\\nLast year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin. When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep. She told him she didn\\'t know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby.\\n\\nIn that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him: \"You will do it, because you can.\" He heard those words. He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids. Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca. In an instant, she agreed to adopt. The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca, you embody the goodness of our nation. Thank you.  Thank you, Ryan and Rebecca.\\n\\nAs we rebuild America\\'s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad.\\n\\nAround the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values. In confronting these horrible dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means to our true and great defense.\\n\\nFor this reason, I am asking Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. \\n\\nAs part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and so powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression by any other nation or anyone else.  \\n\\nPerhaps someday in the future, there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, we are not there yet, sadly. \\n\\nLast year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth. One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria and in other locations, as well.  But there is much more work to be done. We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated.\\n\\nArmy Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight. Near Raqqa, last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosive so that civilians could return to that city hopefully soon, and hopefully safely. \\n\\nClearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion. Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped and unbelievably dangerous and unsafe building, and found Kenton, but in very, very bad shape. He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway. He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport, and maintained artificial respiration through two and a half hours and through emergency surgery.\\n\\nKenton Stacy would have died if it were not for Justin\\'s selfless love for his fellow warrior. Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas. Raqqa is liberated. And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \"V\" for \"valor.\" Staff Sergeant Peck, all of America salutes you. \\n\\nTerrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil. When possible, we have no choice but to annihilate them. When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them. But we must be clear: Terrorists are not merely criminals. They are unlawful enemy combatants.  And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. \\n\\nIn the past, we have foolishly released hundreds and hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield -- including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi, who we captured, who we had, who we released.\\n\\nSo today, I\\'m keeping another promise. I just signed, prior to walking in, an order directing Secretary Mattis, who is doing a great job, thank you --  -- to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities in Guantanamo Bay. \\n\\nI am asking Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al Qaeda, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists, wherever we chase them down, wherever we find them. And in many cases, for them, it will now be Guantanamo Bay. \\n\\nAt the same time, as of a few months ago, our warriors in Afghanistan have new rules of engagement. \\n\\nAlong with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans.  \\n\\nLast month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the U.S. Senate just months before. I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  \\n\\nShortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America\\'s sovereign right to make this decision. In 2016, American taxpayers generously sent those same countries more than $20 billion in aid.\\n\\nThat is why, tonight, I am asking Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to friends of America, not enemies of America.  \\n\\nAs we strengthen friendships all around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries.\\n\\nWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent. America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.  \\n\\nI am asking Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal.\\n\\nMy administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela.  \\n\\nBut no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. North Korea\\'s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.\\n\\nPast experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation. I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this very dangerous position.\\n\\nWe need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and to our allies.\\n\\nOtto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia -- and a great student he was. On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea. At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state. After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June, horribly injured and on the verge of death. He passed away just days after his return.\\n\\nOtto\\'s wonderful parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are here with us tonight, along with Otto\\'s brother and sister, Austin and Greta. Please.  Incredible people. You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength truly inspires us all. Thank you very much. Thank you. \\n\\nTonight, we pledge to honor Otto\\'s memory with total American resolve. Thank you.  \\n\\nFinally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime. His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho.\\n\\nIn 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea. One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food, which were very hard to get. In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger. He woke up as a train ran over his limbs. He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain or the hurt. His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves, permanently stunting their own growth. \\n\\nLater, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China. His tormentors wanted to know if he\\'d met any Christians. He had -- and he resolved, after that, to be free. \\n\\nSeong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches all across China and Southeast Asia to freedom. Most of his family followed. His father was caught trying to escape and was tortured to death.\\n\\nToday he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears most: the truth.\\n\\nToday, he has a new leg. But, Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those old crutches as a reminder of how far you\\'ve come. Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Please. Thank you.  Seong-ho\\'s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom.\\n\\nIt was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America. It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness. It was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea: that they could rule themselves; that they could chart their own destiny; and that, together, they could light up the entire world.\\n\\nThat is what our country has always been about. That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done.\\n\\nAtop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom. She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought, and lived, and died to protect her. Monuments to Washington, and Jefferson, and Lincoln, and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga; to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy and the fields beyond; and others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies all over Asia.\\n\\nAnd freedom stands tall over one more monument: this one. This Capitol -- this living monument -- this is the moment to the American people. \\n\\nWe\\'re a people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us, defending hope, pride, and defending the American way.\\n\\nThey work in every trade. They sacrifice to raise a family. They care for our children at home. They defend our flag abroad. And they are strong moms and brave kids. They are firefighters, and police officers, and border agents, medics, and Marines. But above all else, they are Americans. And this Capitol, this city, this nation, belongs entirely to them. \\n\\nOur task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them.\\n\\nAmericans fill the world with art and music. They push the bounds of science and discovery. And they forever remind us of what we should never, ever forget: The people dreamed this country. The people built this country. And it\\'s the people who are making America great again. \\n\\nAs long as we are proud of who we are and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will never fail.\\n\\nOur families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free.\\n\\nThank you. And God bless America. Goodnight. ',\n",
       " u'Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: Tonight marks the eighth year that I\\'ve come here to report on the State of the Union. And for this final one, I\\'m going to try to make it a little shorter. I know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa.  I\\'ve been there. I\\'ll be shaking hands afterwards if you want some tips. \\n\\nNow, I understand that because it\\'s an election season, expectations for what we will achieve this year are low. But, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the constructive approach that you and other leaders took at the end of last year to pass a budget and make tax cuts permanent for working families. So I hope we can work together this year on some bipartisan priorities like criminal justice reform and helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse and heroin abuse. So, who knows, we might surprise the cynics again. \\n\\nBut tonight I want to go easy on the traditional list of proposals for the year ahead. Don\\'t worry, I\\'ve got plenty&mdash;&mdash;from helping students learn to write computer code to personalizing medical treatments for patients. And I will keep pushing for progress on the work that I believe still needs to be done: fixing a broken immigration system, protecting our kids from gun violence, equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. All these things still matter to hard-working families. They\\'re still the right thing to do. And I won\\'t let up until they get done. \\n\\nBut for my final address to this Chamber, I don\\'t want to just talk about next year. I want to focus on the next 5 years, the next 10 years, and beyond. I want to focus on our future. \\n\\nWe live in a time of extraordinary change, change that\\'s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet, our place in the world. It\\'s change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families. It promises this education for girls in the most remote villages, but also connects terrorists plotting an ocean away. It\\'s change that can broaden opportunity or widen inequality. And whether we like it or not, the pace of this change will only accelerate. \\n\\nAmerica has been through big changes before: wars and depression, the influx of new immigrants, workers fighting for a fair deal, movements to expand civil rights. Each time, there have been those who told us to fear the future; who claimed we could slam the brakes on change; who promised to restore past glory if we just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. And each time, we overcame those fears. We did not, in the words of Lincoln, adhere to the \"dogmas of the quiet past.\" Instead, we thought anew and acted anew. We made change work for us, always extending America\\'s promise outward, to the next frontier, to more people. And because we did, because we saw opportunity with a&mdash;where others saw peril, we emerged stronger and better than before. \\n\\nWhat was true then can be true now. Our unique strengths as a nation&mdash;our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to rule of law&mdash;these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come. \\n\\nIn fact, it\\'s in that spirit that we have made progress these past 7 years. That\\'s how we recovered from the worst economic crisis in generations. That\\'s how we reformed our health care system and reinvented our energy sector. That\\'s how we delivered more care and benefits to our troops coming home and our veterans. That\\'s how we secured the freedom in every State to marry the person we love. \\n\\nBut such progress is not inevitable. It\\'s the result of choices we make together. And we face such choices right now. Will we respond to the changes of our time with fear, turning inward as a nation, turning against each other as a people? Or will we face the future with confidence in who we are, in what we stand for, in the incredible things that we can do together? \\n\\nSo let\\'s talk about the future and four big questions that I believe we as a country have to answer, regardless of who the next President is or who controls the next Congress. First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? Second, how do we make technology work for us and not against us, especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman? And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what\\'s best in us and not what\\'s worst? \\n\\nLet me start with the economy and a basic fact: The United States of America right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world. We\\'re in the middle of the longest streak of private sector job creation in history. More than 14 million new jobs, the strongest 2 years of job growth since the 1990s, an unemployment rate cut in half. Our auto industry just had its best year ever. That\\'s just part of a manufacturing surge that\\'s created nearly 900,000 new jobs in the past 6 years. And we\\'ve done all this while cutting our deficits by almost three-quarters. \\n\\nAnyone claiming that America\\'s economy is in decline is peddling fiction. Now, what is true&mdash;and the reason that a lot of Americans feel anxious&mdash;is that the economy has been changing in profound ways, changes that started long before the great recession hit, changes that have not let up. \\n\\nToday, technology doesn\\'t just replace jobs on the assembly line, but any job where work can be automated. Companies in a global economy can locate anywhere, and they face tougher competition. As a result, workers have less leverage for a raise. Companies have less loyalty to their communities. And more and more wealth and income is concentrated at the very top. \\n\\nAll these trends have squeezed workers, even when they have jobs, even when the economy is growing. It\\'s made it harder for a hard-working family to pull itself out of poverty, harder for young people to start their careers, tougher for workers to retire when they want to. And although none of these trends are unique to America, they do offend our uniquely American belief that everybody who works hard should get a fair shot. \\n\\nFor the past 7 years, our goal has been a growing economy that also works better for everybody. We\\'ve made progress, but we need to make more. And despite all the political arguments that we\\'ve had these past few years, there are actually some areas where Americans broadly agree. \\n\\nWe agree that real opportunity requires every American to get the education and training they need to land a good-paying job. The bipartisan reform of No Child Left Behind was an important start, and together, we\\'ve increased early childhood education, lifted high school graduation rates to new highs, boosted graduates in fields like engineering. In the coming years, we should build on that progress, by providing pre-K for all and offering every student the hands-on computer science and math classes that make them job-ready on day one. We should recruit and support more great teachers for our kids. \\n\\nAnd we have to make college affordable for every American. No hard-working student should be stuck in the red. We\\'ve already reduced student loan payments by&mdash;to 10 percent of a borrower\\'s income. And that\\'s good. But now we\\'ve actually got to cut the cost of college. Providing 2 years of community college at no cost for every responsible student is one of the best ways to do that, and I\\'m going to keep fighting to get that started this year. It\\'s the right thing to do. \\n\\nBut a great education isn\\'t all we need in this new economy. We also need benefits and protections that provide a basic measure of security. It\\'s not too much of a stretch to say that some of the only people in America who are going to work the same job, in the same place, with a health and retirement package for 30 years are sitting in this Chamber.  For everyone else, especially folks in their forties and fifties, saving for retirement or bouncing back from job loss has gotten a lot tougher. Americans understand that at some point in their careers, in this new economy, they may have to retool, they may have to retrain. But they shouldn\\'t lose what they\\'ve already worked so hard to build in the process. \\n\\nThat\\'s why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever. We shouldn\\'t weaken them, we should strengthen them. And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. That, by the way, is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. It\\'s about filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when you lose a job or you go back to school or you strike out and launch that new business, you\\'ll still have coverage. Nearly 18 million people have gained coverage so far. And in the process, health care inflation has slowed. And our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law. \\n\\nNow, I\\'m guessing we won\\'t agree on health care anytime soon, but&mdash;&mdash;a little applause back there.  Just a guess. But there should be other ways parties can work together to improve economic security. Say a hard-working American loses his job. We shouldn\\'t just make sure that he can get unemployment insurance, we should make sure that program encourages him to retrain for a business that\\'s ready to hire him. If that new job doesn\\'t pay as much, there should be a system of wage insurance in place so that he can still pay his bills. And even if he\\'s going from job to job, he should still be able to save for retirement and take his savings with him. That\\'s the way we make the new economy work better for everybody. \\n\\nI also know Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty. America is about giving everybody willing to work a chance, a hand up. And I\\'d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support, like expanding tax cuts for low-income workers who don\\'t have children. \\n\\nBut there are some areas where&mdash;we just have to be honest&mdash;it has been difficult to find agreement over the last 7 years. And a lot of them fall under the category of what role the Government should play in making sure the system\\'s not rigged in favor of the wealthiest and biggest corporations. And it\\'s an honest disagreement, and the American people have a choice to make. \\n\\nI believe a thriving private sector is the lifeblood of our economy. I think there are outdated regulations that need to be changed. There is redtape that needs to be cut.  There you go! Yes! See? But after years now of record corporate profits, working families won\\'t get more opportunity or bigger paychecks just by letting big banks or big oil or hedge funds make their own rules at everybody else\\'s expense. Middle class families are not going to feel more secure because we allowed attacks on collective bargaining to go unanswered. Food stamp recipients did not cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did. Immigrants aren\\'t the principal reason wages haven\\'t gone up; those decisions are made in the boardrooms that all too often put quarterly earnings over long-term returns. It\\'s sure not the average family watching tonight that avoids paying taxes through offshore accounts.  \\n\\nThe point is, I believe that in this new economy, workers and startups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. The rules should work for them. And I\\'m not alone in this. This year, I plan to lift up the many businesses who have figured out that doing right by their workers or their customers or their communities ends up being good for their shareholders. And I want to spread those best practices across America. That\\'s part of a brighter future. \\n\\nIn fact, it turns, out many of our best corporate citizens are also our most creative. And this brings me to the second big question we as a country have to answer: How do we reignite that spirit of innovation to meet our biggest challenges? \\n\\nSixty years ago, when the Russians beat us into space, we didn\\'t deny Sputnik was up there.  We didn\\'t argue about the science or shrink our research and development budget. We built a space program almost overnight. And 12 years later, we were walking on the Moon. \\n\\nNow, that spirit of discovery is in our DNA. America is Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver. America is Grace Hopper and Katherine Johnson and Sally Ride. America is every immigrant and entrepreneur from Boston to Austin to Silicon Valley, racing to shape a better future. That\\'s who we are. \\n\\nAnd over the past 7 years, we\\'ve nurtured that spirit. We\\'ve protected an open Internet and taken bold new steps to get more students and low-income Americans online. We\\'ve launched next-generation manufacturing hubs and online tools that give an entrepreneur everything he or she needs to start a business in a single day. But we can do so much more. \\n\\nLast year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. Last month, he worked with this Congress to give scientists at the National Institutes of Health the strongest resources that they\\'ve had in over a decade. Well&mdash;so tonight I\\'m announcing a new national effort to get it done. And because he\\'s gone to the mat for all of us on so many issues over the past 40 years, I\\'m putting Joe in charge of mission control. For the loved ones we\\'ve all lost, for the families that we can still save, let\\'s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all. What do you say, Joe? Let\\'s make it happen. \\n\\nNow, medical research is critical. We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. Look, if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it.  You will be pretty lonely, because you\\'ll be debating our military, most of America\\'s business leaders, the majority of the American people, almost the entire scientific community, and 200 nations around the world who agree it\\'s a problem and intend to solve it. But even if the planet wasn\\'t at stake, even if 2014 wasn\\'t the warmest year on record&mdash;until 2015 turned out to be even hotter&mdash;why would we want to pass up the chance for American businesses to produce and sell the energy of the future? Listen, 7 years ago, we made the single biggest investment in clean energy in our history. Here are the results. In fields from Iowa to Texas, wind power is now cheaper than dirtier, conventional power. On rooftops from Arizona to New York, solar is saving Americans tens of millions of dollars a year on their energy bills and employs more Americans than coal in jobs that pay better than average. We\\'re taking steps to give homeowners the freedom to generate and store their own energy, something, by the way, that environmentalists and Tea Partiers have teamed up to support. And meanwhile, we\\'ve cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60 percent and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth. Gas under 2 bucks a gallon ain\\'t bad either.  \\n\\nNow we\\'ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources. Rather than subsidize the past, we should invest in the future, especially in communities that rely on fossil fuels. We do them no favor when we don\\'t show them where the trends are going. And that\\'s why I\\'m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. And that way, we put money back into those communities and put tens of thousands of Americans to work building a 21st-century transportation system. \\n\\nNow, none of this is going to happen overnight. And yes, there are plenty of entrenched interests who want to protect the status quo. But the jobs we\\'ll create, the money we\\'ll save, the planet we\\'ll preserve&mdash;that is the kind of future our kids and our grandkids deserve. And it\\'s within our grasp. \\n\\nNow, climate change is just one of many issues where our security is linked to the rest of the world. And that\\'s why the third big question that we have to answer together is how to keep America safe and strong without either isolating ourselves or trying to nation-build everywhere there\\'s a problem. \\n\\nNow, I told you earlier all the talk of America\\'s economic decline is political hot air. Well, so is all the rhetoric you hear about our enemies getting stronger and America getting weaker. Let me tell you something: The United States of America is the most powerful nation on Earth. Period.  Period. It\\'s not even close.  It\\'s not even close. It\\'s not even close. We spend more on our military than the next eight nations combined. Our troops are the finest fighting force in the history of the world.  All right. No nation attacks us directly, or our allies, because they know that\\'s the path to ruin. Surveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office, and when it comes to every important international issue, people of the world do not look to Beijing or Moscow to lead. They call us. So I think it\\'s useful to level set here, because when we don\\'t, we don\\'t make good decisions. \\n\\nNow, as someone who begins every day with an intelligence briefing, I know this is a dangerous time. But that\\'s not primarily because of some looming superpower out there, and it\\'s certainly not because of diminished American strength. In today\\'s world, we\\'re threatened less by evil empires and more by failing states. \\n\\nThe Middle East is going through a transformation that will play out for a generation, rooted in conflicts that date back millennia. Economic headwinds are blowing in from a Chinese economy that is in significant transition. Even as their economy severely contracts, Russia is pouring resources in to prop up Ukraine and Syria, client states that they saw slipping away from their orbit. And the international system we built after World War II is now struggling to keep pace with this new reality. It\\'s up to us, the United States of America, to help remake that system. And to do that well, it means that we\\'ve got to set priorities. Priority number one is protecting the American people and going after terrorist networks. Both Al Qaida and now ISIL pose a direct threat to our people, because in today\\'s world, even a handful of terrorists who place no value on human life, including their own, can do a lot of damage. They use the Internet to poison the minds of individuals inside our country. Their actions undermine and destabilize our allies. We have to take them out. \\n\\nBut as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is world war III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks, twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages, they pose an enormous danger to civilians; they have to be stopped. But they do not threaten our national existence. That is the story ISIL wants to tell. That\\'s the kind of propaganda they use to recruit. We don\\'t need to build them up to show that we\\'re serious, and we sure don\\'t need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is somehow representative of one of the world\\'s largest religions. We just need to call them what they are: killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out, hunted down, and destroyed. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s exactly what we\\'re doing. For more than a year, America has led a coalition of more than 60 countries to cut off ISIL\\'s financing, disrupt their plots, stop the flow of terrorist fighters, and stamp out their vicious ideology. With nearly 10,000 airstrikes, we\\'re taking out their leadership, their oil, their training camps, their weapons. We\\'re training, arming, and supporting forces who are steadily reclaiming territory in Iraq and Syria. \\n\\nIf this Congress is serious about winning this war and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote.  Take a vote. But the American people should know that with or without congressional action, ISIL will learn the same lessons as terrorists before them. If you doubt America\\'s commitment&mdash;or mine&mdash;to see that justice is done, just ask Usama bin Laden. Ask the leader of Al Qaida in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. And it may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limits. \\n\\nOur foreign policy has to be focused on the threat from ISIL and Al Qaida, but it can\\'t stop there. For even without ISIL, even without Al Qaida, instability will continue for decades in many parts of the world: in the Middle East, in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, in parts of Central America, in Africa and Asia. Some of these places may become safe havens for new terrorist networks. Others will just fall victim to ethnic conflict or famine, feeding the next wave of refugees. The world will look to us to help solve these problems, and our answer needs to be more than tough talk or calls to carpet-bomb civilians. That may work as a TV sound bite, but it doesn\\'t pass muster on the world stage. \\n\\nWe also can\\'t try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis, even if it\\'s done with the best of intentions. That\\'s not leadership; that\\'s a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately will weaken us. It\\'s the lesson of Vietnam; it\\'s the lesson of Iraq. And we should have learned it by now. \\n\\nNow, fortunately there is a smarter approach: a patient and disciplined strategy that uses every element of our national power. It says America will always act, alone if necessary, to protect our people and our allies, but on issues of global concern, we will mobilize the world to work with us and make sure other countries pull their own weight. That\\'s our approach to conflicts like Syria, where we\\'re partnering with local forces and leading international efforts to help that broken society pursue a lasting peace. That\\'s why we built a global coalition, with sanctions and principled diplomacy, to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. And as we speak, Iran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war. \\n\\nThat\\'s how we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa. Our military, our doctors, our development workers&mdash;they were heroic; they set up the platform that then allowed other countries to join in behind us and stamp out that epidemic. Hundreds of thousands, maybe a couple million, lives were saved. \\n\\nThat\\'s how we forged a Trans-Pacific Partnership to open markets and protect workers and the environment and advance American leadership in Asia. It cuts 18,000 taxes on products made in America, which will then support more good jobs here in America. With TPP, China does not set the rules in that region, we do. You want to show our strength in this new century? Approve this agreement. Give us the tools to enforce it. It\\'s the right thing to do. \\n\\nLet me give you another example. Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy. It set us back in Latin America. That\\'s why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people. So if you want to consolidate our leadership and credibility in the hemisphere, recognize that the cold war is over. Lift the embargo. \\n\\nThe point is, American leadership in the 21st century is not a choice between ignoring the rest of the world&mdash;except when we kill terrorists&mdash;or occupying and rebuilding whatever society is unraveling. Leadership means a wise application of military power and rallying the world behind causes that are right. It means seeing our foreign assistance as a part of our national security, not something separate, not charity. \\n\\nWhen we lead nearly 200 nations to the most ambitious agreement in history to fight climate change, yes, that helps vulnerable countries, but it also protects our kids. When we help Ukraine defend its democracy or Colombia resolve a decades-long war, that strengthens the international order we depend on. When we help African countries feed their people and care for the sick, it\\'s the right thing to do, and it prevents the next pandemic from reaching our shores. Right now we\\'re on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS. That\\'s within our grasp. And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria, something I\\'ll be pushing this Congress to fund this year. \\n\\nThat\\'s American strength. That\\'s American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example. That\\'s why I will keep working to shut down the prison at Guantanamo. It is expensive, it is unnecessary, and it only serves as a recruitment brochure for our enemies. There\\'s a better way. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why we need to reject any politics&mdash;any politics&mdash;that targets people because of race or religion. Let me just say this. This is not a matter of political correctness, this is a matter of understanding just what it is that makes us strong. The world respects us not just for our arsenal, it respects us for our diversity and our openness and the way we respect every faith. \\n\\nHis Holiness Pope Francis told this body from the very spot that I\\'m standing on tonight that \"to imitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best way to take their place.\" When politicians insult Muslims, whether abroad or our fellow citizens, when a mosque is vandalized or a kid is called names, that doesn\\'t make us safer. That\\'s not telling it what&mdash;telling it like it is. It\\'s just wrong. It diminishes us in the eyes of the world. It makes it harder to achieve our goals. It betrays who we are as a country. \"We the People.\" Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we\\'ve come to recognize mean all the people, not just some; words that insist we rise and fall together, that that\\'s how we might perfect our Union. And that brings me to the fourth and maybe most important thing that I want to say tonight. \\n\\nThe future we want&mdash;all of us want&mdash;opportunity and security for our families, a rising standard of living, a sustainable, peaceful planet for our kids&mdash;all that is within our reach. But it will only happen if we work together. It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. It will only happen if we fix our politics. \\n\\nA better politics doesn\\'t mean we have to agree on everything. This is a big country: different regions, different attitudes, different interests. That\\'s one of our strengths too. Our Founders distributed power between States and branches of government and expected us to argue, just as they did, fiercely, over the size and shape of government, over commerce and foreign relations, over the meaning of liberty and the imperatives of security. \\n\\nBut democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens. It doesn\\'t work if we think the people who disagree with us are all motivated by malice. It doesn\\'t work if we think that our political opponents are unpatriotic or trying to weaken America. Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise or when even basic facts are contested or when we listen only to those who agree with us. Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get all the attention. And most of all, democracy breaks down when the average person feels their voice doesn\\'t matter, that the system is rigged in favor of the rich or the powerful or some special interest. \\n\\nToo many Americans feel that way right now. It\\'s one of the few regrets of my Presidency: that the rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better. I have no doubt, a President with the gifts of Lincoln or Roosevelt might have better bridged the divide, and I guarantee, I\\'ll keep trying to be better so long as I hold this office. \\n\\nBut, my fellow Americans, this cannot be my task&mdash;or any President\\'s&mdash;alone. There are a whole lot of folks in this Chamber, good people, who would like to see more cooperation, would like to see a more elevated debate in Washington, but feel trapped by the imperatives of getting elected, by the noise coming out of your base. I know; you\\'ve told me. It\\'s the worst kept secret in Washington. And a lot of you aren\\'t enjoying being trapped in that kind of rancor. \\n\\nBut that means if we want a better politics&mdash;and I\\'m addressing the American people now&mdash;if we want a better politics, it\\'s not enough just to change a Congressman or change a Senator or even change a President. We have to change the system to reflect our better selves. \\n\\nI think we\\'ve got to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters and not the other way around. Let a bipartisan group do it. \\n\\nI believe we\\'ve got to reduce the influence of money in our politics so that a handful of families or hidden interests can\\'t bankroll our elections. And if our existing approach to campaign finance reform can\\'t pass muster in the courts, we need to work together to find a real solution. Because it\\'s a problem. And most of you don\\'t like raising money.  I know. I\\'ve done it. \\n\\nWe\\'ve got to make it easier to vote, not harder. We need to modernize it for the way we live now. This is America: We want to make it easier for people to participate. And over the course of this year, I intend to travel the country to push for reforms that do just that. But I can\\'t do these things on my own. Changes in our political process&mdash;in not just who gets elected, but how they get elected&mdash;that will only happen when the American people demand it. It depends on you. That\\'s what\\'s meant by a government of, by, and for the people. \\n\\nWhat I\\'m suggesting is hard. It\\'s a lot easier to be cynical; to accept that change is not possible and politics is hopeless and the problem is, all the folks who are elected don\\'t care; and to believe that our voices and our actions don\\'t matter. But if we give up now, then we forsake a better future. Those with money and power will gain greater control over the decisions that could send a young soldier to war or allow another economic disaster or roll back the equal rights and voting rights that generations of Americans have fought, even died, to secure. And then, as frustration grows, there will be voices urging us to fall back into our respective tribes, to scapegoat fellow citizens who don\\'t look like us or pray like us or vote like we do or share the same background. \\n\\nWe can\\'t afford to go down that path. It won\\'t deliver the economy we want. It will not produce the security we want. But most of all, it contradicts everything that makes us the envy of the world. \\n\\nSo, my fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective futures depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. We need every American to stay active in our public life&mdash;and not just during election time&mdash;so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day. \\n\\nIt is not easy. Our brand of democracy is hard. But I can promise that a little over a year from now, when I no longer hold this office, I will be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by those voices of fairness and vision, of grit and good humor and kindness, that have helped America travel so far. Voices that help us see ourselves not, first and foremost, as Black or White or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not Democrat or Republican, but as Americans first, bound by a common creed. Voices Dr. King believed would have the final word: voices of \"unarmed truth and unconditional love.\" \\n\\nAnd they\\'re out there, those voices. They don\\'t get a lot of attention; they don\\'t seek a lot of fanfare; but they\\'re busy doing the work this country needs doing. I see them everywhere I travel in this incredible country of ours. I see you, the American people. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I see our future unfolding. \\n\\nI see it in the worker on the assembly line who clocked extra shifts to keep his company open and the boss who pays him higher wages instead of laying him off. I see it in the dreamer who stays up late at night to finish her science project and the teacher who comes in early, maybe with some extra supplies that she bought because she knows that that young girl might someday cure a disease. \\n\\nI see it in the American who served his time, made bad mistakes as a child, but now is dreaming of starting over. And I see it in the business owner who gives him that second chance. The protester determined to prove that justice matters and the young cop walking the beat, treating everybody with respect, doing the brave, quiet work of keeping us safe. \\n\\nI see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him till he can run a marathon, the community that lines up to cheer him on. It\\'s the son who finds the courage to come out as who he is and the father whose love for that son overrides everything he\\'s been taught. \\n\\nI see it in the elderly woman who will wait in line to cast her vote as long as she has to, the new citizen who casts his vote for the first time, the volunteers at the polls who believe every vote should count. Because each of them, in different ways, know how much that precious right is worth. \\n\\nThat\\'s the America I know. That\\'s the country we love: clear eyed, big hearted, undaunted by challenge. Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word. That\\'s what makes me so hopeful about our future. I believe in change because I believe in you, the American people. And that\\'s why I stand here as confident as I have ever been that the state of our Union is strong. \\n\\nThank you. God bless you. God bless the United States of America. Thank you.',\n",
       " u'Thank you all. Madam Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens: Seven years have passed since I first stood before you at this rostrum. In that time, our country has been tested in ways none of us could have imagined. We faced hard decisions about peace and war, rising competition in the world economy, and the health and welfare of our citizens. These issues call for vigorous debate, and I think it\\'s fair to say, we\\'ve answered the call.  Yet history will record that amid our differences, we acted with purpose, and together we showed the world the power and resilience of American self-government.\\n\\nAll of us were sent to Washington to carry out the people\\'s business. That is the purpose of this body. It is the meaning of our oath. It remains our charge to keep. \\n\\nThe actions of the 110th Congress will affect the security and prosperity of our Nation long after this session has ended. In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them. Let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and cooperate for results at the same time. \\n\\nFrom expanding opportunity to protecting our country, we\\'ve made good progress. Yet we have unfinished business before us, and the American people expect us to get it done. \\n\\nIn the work ahead, we must be guided by the philosophy that made our Nation great. As Americans, we believe in the power of individuals to determine their destiny and shape the course of history. We believe that the most reliable guide for our country is the collective wisdom of ordinary citizens. And so in all we do, we must trust in the ability of free peoples to make wise decisions and empower them to improve their lives for their futures. \\n\\nTo build a prosperous future, we must trust people with their own money and empower them to grow our economy. As we meet tonight, our economy is undergoing a period of uncertainty. America has added jobs for a record 52 straight months, but jobs are now growing at a slower pace. Wages are up, but so are prices for food and gas. Exports are rising, but the housing market has declined. At kitchen tables across our country, there is a concern about our economic future. \\n\\nIn the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth. But in the short run, we can all see that that growth is slowing. So last week, my administration reached agreement with Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader Boehner on a robust growth package that includes tax relief for individuals and families and incentives for business investment. The temptation will be to load up the bill. That would delay it or derail it, and neither option is acceptable. This is a good agreement that will keep our economy growing and our people working, and this Congress must pass it as soon as possible. \\n\\nWe have other work to do on taxes. Unless Congress acts, most of the tax relief we\\'ve delivered over the past 7 years will be taken away. Some in Washington argue that letting tax relief expire is not a tax increase. Try explaining that to 116 million American taxpayers who would see their taxes rise by an average of $1,800. Others have said they would personally be happy to pay higher taxes. I welcome their enthusiasm. I\\'m pleased to report that the IRS accepts both checks and money orders.  \\n\\nMost Americans think their taxes are high enough. With all the other pressures on their finances, American families should not have to worry about their Federal Government taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. There\\'s only one way to eliminate this uncertainty: Make the tax relief permanent. And Members of Congress should know, if any bill raises taxes reaches my desk, I will veto it. \\n\\nJust as we trust Americans with their own money, we need to earn their trust by spending their tax dollars wisely. Next week, I\\'ll send you a budget that terminates or substantially reduces 151 wasteful or bloated programs, totaling more than $18 billion. The budget that I will submit will keep America on track for a surplus in 2012. American families have to balance their budgets; so should their Government. \\n\\nThe people\\'s trust in their Government is undermined by congressional earmarks, special interest projects that are often snuck in at the last minute, without discussion or debate. Last year, I asked you to voluntarily cut the number and cost of earmarks in half. I also asked you to stop slipping earmarks into committee reports that never even come to a vote. Unfortunately, neither goal was met. So this time, if you send me an appropriations bill that does not cut the number and cost of earmarks in half, I\\'ll send it back to you with my veto. \\n\\nAnd tomorrow I will issue an Executive order that directs Federal agencies to ignore any future earmark that is not voted on by Congress. If these items are truly worth funding, Congress should debate them in the open and hold a public vote. \\n\\nOur shared responsibilities extend beyond matters of taxes and spending. On housing, we must trust Americans with the responsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent times in the housing market. My administration brought together the HOPE NOW Alliance, which is helping many struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure. And Congress can help even more. Tonight I ask you to pass legislation to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modernize the Federal Housing Administration, and allow State housing agencies to issue tax-free bonds to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. These are difficult times for many American families, and by taking these steps, we can help more of them keep their homes. \\n\\nTo build a future of quality health care, we must trust patients and doctors to make medical decisions and empower them with better information and better options. We share a common goal: making health care more affordable and accessible for all Americans. The best way to achieve that goal is by expanding consumer choice, not Government control. So I have proposed ending the bias in the Tax Code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer. This one reform would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass it this year. \\n\\nCongress must also expand health savings accounts, create association health plans for small businesses, promote health information technology, and confront the epidemic of junk medical lawsuits. With all these steps, we will ensure that decisions about your medical care are made in the privacy of your doctor\\'s office, not in the Halls of Congress. \\n\\nOn education, we must trust students to learn, if given the chance, and empower parents to demand results from our schools. In neighborhoods across our country, there are boys and girls with dreams, and a decent education is their only hope of achieving them. \\n\\nSix years ago, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, and today, no one can deny its results. Last year, fourth and eighth graders achieved the highest math scores on record. Reading scores are on the rise. African American and Hispanic students posted alltime highs. Now we must work together to increase accountability, add flexibilities for States and districts, reduce the number of high school dropouts, provide extra help for struggling schools. \\n\\nMembers of Congress, the No Child Left Behind Act is a bipartisan achievement. It is succeeding, and we owe it to America\\'s children, their parents, and their teachers to strengthen this good law. \\n\\nWe must also do more to help children when their schools do not measure up. Thanks to the DC Opportunity Scholarships you approved, more than 2,600 of the poorest children in our Nation\\'s Capital have found new hope at a faith-based or other nonpublic school. Sadly, these schools are disappearing at an alarming rate in many of America\\'s inner cities. So I will convene a White House summit aimed at strengthening these lifelines of learning. And to open the doors of these schools to more children, I ask you to support a new $300 million program called Pell Grants for Kids. We have seen how Pell grants help low-income college students realize their full potential. Together, we\\'ve expanded the size and reach of these grants. Now let us apply the same spirit to help liberate poor children trapped in failing public schools. \\n\\nOn trade, we must trust American workers to compete with anyone in the world and empower them by opening up new markets overseas. Today, our economic growth increasingly depends on our ability to sell American goods and crops and services all over the world. So we\\'re working to break down barriers to trade and investment wherever we can. We\\'re working for a successful Doha round of trade talks, and we must complete a good agreement this year. At the same time, we\\'re pursuing opportunities to open up new markets by passing free trade agreements. \\n\\nI thank the Congress for approving a good agreement with Peru. And now I ask you to approve agreements with Colombia and Panama and South Korea. Many products from these nations now enter America duty free, yet many of our products face steep tariffs in their markets. These agreements will level the playing field. They will give us better access to nearly 100 million customers. They will support good jobs for the finest workers in the world, those whose products say \"Made in the U.S.A.\" \\n\\nThese agreements also promote America\\'s strategic interests. The first agreement that will come before you is with Colombia, a friend of America that is confronting violence and terror and fighting drug traffickers. If we fail to pass this agreement, we will embolden the purveyors of false populism in our hemisphere. So we must come together, pass this agreement, and show our neighbors in the region that democracy leads to a better life. \\n\\nTrade brings better jobs and better choices and better prices. Yet for some Americans, trade can mean losing a job, and the Federal Government has a responsibility to help. I ask Congress to reauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so we can help these displaced workers learn new skills and find new jobs. \\n\\nTo build a future of energy security, we must trust in the creative genius of American researchers and entrepreneurs and empower them to pioneer a new generation of clean energy technology. Our security, our prosperity, and our environment all require reducing our dependence on oil. \\n\\nLast year, I asked you to pass legislation to reduce oil consumption over the next decade, and you responded. Together, we should take the next steps. Let us fund new technologies that can generate coal power while capturing carbon emissions. Let us increase the use of renewable power and emissions-free nuclear power. Let us continue investing in advanced battery technology and renewable fuels to power the cars and trucks of the future. Let us create a new international clean technology fund, which will help developing nations like India and China make a greater use of clean energy sources. And let us complete an international agreement that has the potential to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases. \\n\\nThis agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride. The United States is committed to strengthening our energy security and confronting global climate change. And the best way to meet these goals is for America to continue leading the way toward the development of cleaner and more energy efficient technology. \\n\\nTo keep America competitive into the future, we must trust in the skill of our scientists and engineers and empower them to pursue the breakthroughs of tomorrow. Last year, Congress passed legislation supporting the American Competitiveness Initiative, but never followed through with the funding. This funding is essential to keeping our scientific edge. So I ask Congress to double Federal support for critical basic research in the physical sciences and ensure America remains the most dynamic nation on Earth. \\n\\nOn matters of life and science, we must trust in the innovative spirit of medical researchers and empower them to discover new treatments while respecting moral boundaries. In November, we witnessed a landmark achievement when scientists discovered a way to reprogram adult skin cells to act like embryonic stem cells. This breakthrough has the potential to move us beyond the divisive debates of the past by extending the frontiers of medicine without the destruction of human life. \\n\\nSo we\\'re expanding funding for this type of ethical medical research. And as we explore promising avenues of research, we must also ensure that all life is treated with the dignity it deserves. And so I call on Congress to pass legislation that bans unethical practices, such as the buying, selling, patenting, or cloning of human life. \\n\\nOn matters of justice, we must trust in the wisdom of our Founders and empower judges who understand that the Constitution means what it says. I\\'ve submitted judicial nominees who will rule by the letter of the law, not the whim of the gavel. Many of these nominees are being unfairly delayed. They are worthy of confirmation, and the Senate should give each of them a prompt up-or-down vote. \\n\\nIn communities across our land, we must trust in the good heart of the American people and empower them to serve their neighbors in need. Over the past 7 years, more of our fellow citizens have discovered that the pursuit of happiness leads to the path of service. Americans have volunteered in record numbers. Charitable donations are higher than ever. Faith-based groups are bringing hope to pockets of despair, with newfound support from the Federal Government. And to help guarantee equal treatment of faith-based organizations when they compete for Federal funds, I ask you to permanently extend charitable choice. \\n\\nTonight the armies of compassion continue the march to a new day in the Gulf Coast. America honors the strength and resilience of the people of this region. We reaffirm our pledge to help them build stronger and better than before. And tonight I\\'m pleased to announce that in April, we will host this year\\'s North American Summit of Canada, Mexico, and the United States in the great city of New Orleans. \\n\\nThere are two other pressing challenges that I\\'ve raised repeatedly before this body and that this body has failed to address: entitlement spending and immigration. Every Member in this Chamber knows that spending on entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is growing faster than we can afford. We all know the painful choices ahead if America stays on this path: massive tax increases, sudden and drastic cuts in benefits, or crippling deficits. I\\'ve laid out proposals to reform these programs. Now I ask Members of Congress to offer your proposals and come up with a bipartisan solution to save these vital programs for our children and our grandchildren. \\n\\nThe other pressing challenge is immigration. America needs to secure our borders, and with your help, my administration is taking steps to do so. We\\'re increasing worksite enforcement, deploying fences and advanced technologies to stop illegal crossings. We\\'ve effectively ended the policy of catch-and-release at the border, and by the end of this year, we will have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. Yet we also need to acknowledge that we will never fully secure our border until we create a lawful way for foreign workers to come here and support our economy. This will take pressure off the border and allow law enforcement to concentrate on those who mean us harm. \\n\\nWe must also find a sensible and humane way to deal with people here illegally. Illegal immigration is complicated, but it can be resolved. And it must be resolved in a way that upholds both our laws and our highest ideals. \\n\\nThis is the business of our Nation here at home. Yet building a prosperous future for our citizens also depends on confronting enemies abroad and advancing liberty in troubled regions of the world. \\n\\nOur foreign policy is based on a clear premise: We trust that people, when given the chance, will choose a future of freedom and peace. In the last 7 years, we have witnessed stirring moments in the history of liberty. We\\'ve seen citizens in Georgia and Ukraine stand up for their right to free and fair elections. We\\'ve seen people in Lebanon take to the streets to demand their independence. We\\'ve seen Afghans emerge from the tyranny of the Taliban and choose a new President and a new parliament. We\\'ve seen jubilant Iraqis holding up ink-stained fingers and celebrating their freedom. These images of liberty have inspired us. \\n\\nIn the past 7 years, we\\'ve also seen the images that have sobered us. We\\'ve watched throngs of mourners in Lebanon and Pakistan carrying the caskets of beloved leaders taken by the assassin\\'s hand. We\\'ve seen wedding guests in blood-soaked finery staggering from a hotel in Jordan, Afghans and Iraqis blown up in mosques and markets, and trains in London and Madrid ripped apart by bombs. On a clear September day, we saw thousands of our fellow citizens taken from us in an instant. These horrific images serve as a grim reminder: The advance of liberty is opposed by terrorists and extremists, evil men who despise freedom, despise America, and aim to subject millions to their violent rule. \\n\\nSince 9/11, we have taken the fight to these terrorists and extremists. We will stay on the offense, we will keep up the pressure, and we will deliver justice to our enemies. \\n\\nWe are engaged in the defining ideological struggle of the 21st century. The terrorists oppose every principle of humanity and decency that we hold dear. Yet in this war on terror, there is one thing we and our enemies agree on: In the long run, men and women who are free to determine their own destinies will reject terror and refuse to live in tyranny. And that is why the terrorists are fighting to deny this choice to the people in Lebanon, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Territories. And that is why, for the security of America and the peace of the world, we are spreading the hope of freedom. \\n\\nIn Afghanistan, America, our 25 NATO allies, and 15 partner nations are helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and rebuild their country. Thanks to the courage of these military and civilian personnel, a nation that was once a safe haven for Al Qaida is now a young democracy where boys and girls are going to school, new roads and hospitals are being built, and people are looking to the future with new hope. These successes must continue, so we\\'re adding 3,200 marines to our forces in Afghanistan, where they will fight the terrorists and train the Afghan Army and police. Defeating the Taliban and Al Qaida is critical to our security, and I thank the Congress for supporting America\\'s vital mission in Afghanistan. \\n\\nIn Iraq, the terrorists and extremists are fighting to deny a proud people their liberty and fighting to establish safe havens for attacks across the world. One year ago, our enemies were succeeding in their efforts to plunge Iraq into chaos. So we reviewed our strategy and changed course. We launched a surge of American forces into Iraq. We gave our troops a new mission: work with the Iraqi forces to protect the Iraqi people, pursue the enemy in its strongholds, and deny the terrorists sanctuary anywhere in the country. \\n\\nThe Iraqi people quickly realized that something dramatic had happened. Those who had worried that America was preparing to abandon them instead saw tens of thousands of American forces flowing into their country. They saw our forces moving into neighborhoods, clearing out the terrorists, and staying behind to ensure the enemy did not return. And they saw our troops, along with Provincial Reconstruction Teams that include Foreign Service officers and other skilled public servants, coming in to ensure that improved security was followed by improvements in daily life. Our military and civilians in Iraq are performing with courage and distinction, and they have the gratitude of our whole Nation. \\n\\nThe Iraqis launched a surge of their own. In the fall of 2006, Sunni tribal leaders grew tired of Al Qaida\\'s brutality, started a popular uprising called the Anbar Awakening. Over the past year, similar movements have spread across the country. And today, the grassroots surge includes more than 80,000 Iraqi citizens who are fighting the terrorists. The Government in Baghdad has stepped forward as well, adding more than 100,000 new Iraqi soldiers and police during the past year. \\n\\nWhile the enemy is still dangerous and more work remains, the American and Iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just 1 year ago. When we met last year, many said that containing the violence was impossible. A year later, high-profile terrorist attacks are down, civilian deaths are down, sectarian killings are down. \\n\\nWhen we met last year, militia extremists&mdash;some armed and trained by Iran&mdash; were wreaking havoc in large areas of Iraq. A year later, coalition and Iraqi forces have killed or captured hundreds of militia fighters. And Iraqis of all backgrounds increasingly realize that defeating these militia fighters is critical to the future of their country. \\n\\nWhen we met last year, Al Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is Al Qaida that is searching for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held. And over the past year, we\\'ve captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key Al Qaida leaders and operatives. \\n\\nLast month, Usama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on Al Qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. Al Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated. \\n\\nWhen we met last year, our troop levels in Iraq were on the rise. Today, because of the progress just described, we are implementing a policy of return on success, and the surge forces we sent to Iraq are beginning to come home. \\n\\nThis progress is a credit to the valor of our troops and the brilliance of their commanders. This evening I want to speak directly to our men and women on the frontlines. Soldiers and sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen: In the past year, you have done everything we\\'ve asked of you and more. Our Nation is grateful for your courage. We are proud of your accomplishments. And tonight in this hallowed Chamber, with the American people as our witness, we make you a solemn pledge: In the fight ahead, you will have all you need to protect our Nation. And I ask Congress to meet its responsibilities to these brave men and women by fully funding our troops. \\n\\nOur enemies in Iraq have been hit hard. They are not yet defeated, and we can still expect tough fighting ahead. Our objective in the coming year is to sustain and build on the gains we made in 2007 while transitioning to the next phase of our strategy. American troops are shifting from leading operations to partnering with Iraqi forces and, eventually, to a protective overwatch mission. As part of this transition, one Army brigade combat team and one Marine expeditionary unit have already come home and will not be replaced. In the coming months, four additional brigades and two Marine battalions will follow suit. Taken together, this means more than 20,000 of our troops are coming home. \\n\\nAny further drawdown of U.S. troops will be based on conditions in Iraq and the recommendations of our commanders. General Petraeus has warned that too fast a drawdown could result in, quote, \"the disintegration of the Iraqi security forces, Al Qaida-Iraq regaining lost ground, and a marked increase in violence.\" Members of Congress, having come so far and achieved so much, we must not allow this to happen. \\n\\nIn the coming year, we will work with Iraqi leaders as they build on the progress they\\'re making toward political reconciliation. At the local level, Sunnis, Shi\\'a, and Kurds are beginning to come together to reclaim their communities and rebuild their lives. Progress in the Provinces must be matched by progress in Baghdad. We\\'re seeing some encouraging signs. The national Government is sharing oil revenues with the Provinces. The parliament recently passed both a pension law and de-Ba\\'athification reform. They\\'re now debating a Provincial powers law. The Iraqis still have a distance to travel, but after decades of dictatorship and the pain of sectarian violence, reconciliation is taking place, and the Iraqi people are taking control of their future. \\n\\nThe mission in Iraq has been difficult and trying for our Nation, but it is in the vital interest of the United States that we succeed. A free Iraq will deny Al Qaida a safe haven. A free Iraq will show millions across the Middle East that a future of liberty is possible. A free Iraq will be a friend of America, a partner in fighting terror, and a source of stability in a dangerous part of the world. \\n\\nBy contrast, a failed Iraq would embolden the extremists, strengthen Iran, and give terrorists a base from which to launch new attacks on our friends, our allies, and our homeland. The enemy has made its intentions clear. At a time when the momentum seemed to favor them, Al Qaida\\'s top commander in Iraq declared that they will not rest until they have attacked us here in Washington. My fellow Americans, we will not rest either. We will not rest until this enemy has been defeated. We must do the difficult work today so that years from now, people will look back and say that this generation rose to the moment, prevailed in a tough fight, and left behind a more hopeful region and a safer America. \\n\\nWe\\'re also standing against the forces of extremism in the Holy Land, where we have new cause for hope. Palestinians have elected a President who recognizes that confronting terror is essential to achieving a state where his people can live in dignity and at peace with Israel. Israelis have leaders who recognize that a peaceful, democratic Palestinian state will be a source of lasting security. This month in Ramallah and Jerusalem, I assured leaders from both sides that America will do, and I will do, everything we can to help them achieve a peace agreement that defines a Palestinian state by the end of this year. The time has come for a Holy Land where a democratic Israel and a democratic Palestine live side by side in peace. \\n\\nWe\\'re also standing against the forces of extremism embodied by the regime in Tehran. Iran\\'s rulers oppress a good and talented people. And wherever freedom advances in the Middle East, it seems the Iranian regime is there to oppose it. Iran is funding and training militia groups in Iraq, supporting Hizballah terrorists in Lebanon, and backing Hamas efforts to undermine peace in the Holy Land. Tehran is also developing ballistic missiles of increasing range and continues to develop its capability to enrich uranium, which could be used to create a nuclear weapon. \\n\\nOur message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you. We respect your traditions and your history. We look forward to the day when you have your freedom. Our message to the leaders of Iran is also clear: Verifiably suspend your nuclear enrichment so negotiations can begin. And to rejoin the community of nations, come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, cease your support for terror abroad. But above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops, we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf. \\n\\nOn the homefront, we will continue to take every lawful and effective measure to protect our country. This is our most solemn duty. We are grateful that there has not been another attack on our soil since 9/11. This is not for the lack of desire or effort on the part of the enemy. In the past 6 years, we\\'ve stopped numerous attacks, including a plot to fly a plane into the tallest building in Los Angeles and another to blow up passenger jets bound for America over the Atlantic. Dedicated men and women in our Government toil day and night to stop the terrorists from carrying out their plans. These good citizens are saving American lives, and everyone in this Chamber owes them our thanks. \\n\\nAnd we owe them something more; we owe them the tools they need to keep our people safe. And one of the most important tools we can give them is the ability to monitor terrorist communications. To protect America, we need to know who the terrorists are talking to, what they are saying, and what they\\'re planning. Last year, Congress passed legislation to help us do that. Unfortunately, Congress set the legislations to expire on February the 1st. That means if you don\\'t act by Friday, our ability to track terrorist threats would be weakened and our citizens will be in greater danger. Congress must ensure the flow of vital intelligence is not disrupted. Congress must pass liability protection for companies believed to have assisted in the efforts to defend America. We\\'ve had ample time for debate. The time to act is now. \\n\\nProtecting our Nation from the dangers of a new century requires more than good intelligence and a strong military. It also requires changing the conditions that breed resentment and allow extremists to prey on despair. So America is using its influence to build a freer, more hopeful, and more compassionate world. This is a reflection of our national interests; it is the calling of our conscience. \\n\\nAmerica opposes genocide in Sudan. We support freedom in countries from Cuba and Zimbabwe to Belarus and Burma. \\n\\nAmerica is leading the fight against global poverty with strong education initiatives and humanitarian assistance. We\\'ve also changed the way we deliver aid by launching the Millennium Challenge Account. This program strengthens democracy, transparency, and the rule of law in developing nations, and I ask you to fully fund this important initiative. \\n\\nAmerica is leading the fight against global hunger. Today, more than half the world\\'s food aid comes from the United States. And tonight I ask Congress to support an innovative proposal to provide food assistance by purchasing crops directly from farmers in the developing world, so we can build up local agriculture and help break the cycle of famine. \\n\\nAmerica is leading the fight against disease. With your help, we\\'re working to cut by half the number of malaria-related deaths in 15 African nations. And our Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is treating 1.4 million people. We can bring healing and hope to many more. So I ask you to maintain the principles that have changed behavior and made this program a success. And I call on you to double our initial commitment to fighting HIV/AIDS by approving an additional $30 billion over the next 5 years. \\n\\nAmerica is a force for hope in the world because we are a compassionate people, and some of the most compassionate Americans are those who have stepped forward to protect us. We must keep faith with all who have risked life and limb so that we might live in freedom and peace. Over the past 7 years, we\\'ve increased funding for veterans by more than 95 percent. And as we increase funding, we must also reform our veterans system to meet the needs of a new war and a new generation. I call on Congress to enact the reforms recommended by Senator Bob Dole and Secretary Donna Shalala so we can improve the system of care for our wounded warriors and help them build lives of hope and promise and dignity. \\n\\nOur military families also sacrifice for America. They endure sleepless nights and the daily struggle of providing for children while a loved one is serving far from home. We have a responsibility to provide for them. So I ask you to join me in expanding their access to child care, creating new hiring preferences for military spouses across the Federal Government, and allowing our troops to transfer their unused education benefits to their spouses or children. Our military families serve our Nation, they inspire our Nation, and tonight our Nation honors them. \\n\\nThe strength&mdash;the secret of our strength, the miracle of America, is that our greatness lies not in our Government, but in the spirit and determination of our people. When the Federal Convention met in Philadelphia in 1787, our Nation was bound by the Articles of Confederation, which began with the words, \"We the undersigned delegates.\" When Gouverneur Morris was asked to draft the preamble to our new Constitution, he offered an important revision and opened with words that changed the course of our Nation and the history of the world: \"We the people.\" \\n\\nBy trusting the people, our Founders wagered that a great and noble nation could be built on the liberty that resides in the hearts of all men and women. By trusting the people, succeeding generations transformed our fragile, young democracy into the most powerful nation on Earth and a beacon of hope for millions. And so long as we continue to trust the people, our Nation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and the state of our Union will remain strong. \\n\\nSo tonight, with confidence in freedom\\'s power and trust in the people, let us set forth to do their business. God bless America.',\n",
       " u'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, honored guests, my fellow Americans:\\n\\nWe are fortunate to be alive at this moment in history. Never before has our Nation enjoyed, at once, so much prosperity and social progress with so little internal crisis and so few external threats. Never before have we had such a blessed opportunity and, therefore, such a profound obligation to build the more perfect Union of our Founders\\' dreams. \\n\\nWe begin the new century with over 20 million new jobs; the fastest economic growth in more than 30 years; the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years; the lowest poverty rates in 20 years; the lowest African-American and Hispanic unemployment rates on record; the first back-to-back surpluses in 42 years; and next month, America will achieve the longest period of economic growth in our entire history. We have built a new economy. \\n\\nAnd our economic revolution has been matched by a revival of the American spirit: crime down by 20 percent, to its lowest level in 25 years; teen births down 7 years in a row; adoptions up by 30 percent; welfare rolls cut in half, to their lowest levels in 30 years. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans, the state of our Union is the strongest it has ever been. \\n\\nAs always, the real credit belongs to the American people. My gratitude also goes to those of you in this Chamber who have worked with us to put progress over partisanship. \\n\\nEight years ago, it was not so clear to most Americans there would be much to celebrate in the year 2000. Then our Nation was gripped by economic distress, social decline, political gridlock. The title of a best-selling book asked: \"America: What Went Wrong?\" \\n\\nIn the best traditions of our Nation, Americans determined to set things right. We restored the vital center, replacing outmoded ideologies with a new vision anchored in basic, enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans. We reinvented Government, transforming it into a catalyst for new ideas that stress both opportunity and responsibility and give our people the tools they need to solve their own problems. \\n\\nWith the smallest Federal work force in 40 years, we turned record deficits into record surpluses and doubled our investment in education. We cut crime with 100,000 community police and the Brady law, which has kept guns out of the hands of half a million criminals. \\n\\nWe ended welfare as we knew it, requiring work while protecting health care and nutrition for children and investing more in child care, transportation, and housing to help their parents go to work. We\\'ve helped parents to succeed at home and at work with family leave, which 20 million Americans have now used to care for a newborn child or a sick loved one. We\\'ve engaged 150,000 young Americans in citizen service through AmeriCorps, while helping them earn money for college. \\n\\nIn 1992, we just had a roadmap. Today, we have results. \\n\\nEven more important, America again has the confidence to dream big dreams. But we must not let this confidence drift into complacency. For we, all of us, will be judged by the dreams and deeds we pass on to our children. And on that score, we will be held to a high standard, indeed, because our chance to do good is so great. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans, we have crossed the bridge we built to the 21st century. Now, we must shape a 21st century American revolution of opportunity, responsibility, and community. We must be now, as we were in the beginning, a new nation. \\n\\nAt the dawn of the last century, Theodore Roosevelt said, \"The one characteristic more essential than any other is foresight . . . it should be the growing Nation with a future that takes the long look ahead.\" So tonight let us take our long look ahead and set great goals for our Nation. \\n\\nTo 21st century America, let us pledge these things: Every child will begin school ready to learn and graduate ready to succeed. Every family will be able to succeed at home and at work, and no child will be raised in poverty. We will meet the challenge of the aging of America. We will assure quality, affordable health care, at last, for all Americans. We will make America the safest big country on Earth. We will pay off our national debt for the first time since 1835.* We will bring prosperity to every American community. We will reverse the course of climate change and leave a safer, cleaner planet. America will lead the world toward shared peace and prosperity and the far frontiers of science and technology. And we will become at last what our Founders pledged us to be so long ago: One Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. \\n\\nThese are great goals, worthy of a great nation. We will not reach them all this year, not even in this decade. But we will reach them. Let us remember that the first American Revolution was not won with a single shot; the continent was not settled in a single year. The lesson of our history and the lesson of the last 7 years is that great goals are reached step by step, always building on our progress, always gaining ground. \\n\\nOf course, you can\\'t gain ground if you\\'re standing still. And for too long this Congress has been standing still on some of our most pressing national priorities. So let\\'s begin tonight with them. \\n\\nAgain, I ask you to pass a real Patients\\' Bill of Rights. I ask you to pass commonsense gun safety legislation. I ask you to pass campaign finance reform. I ask you to vote up or down on judicial nominations and other important appointees. And again, I ask you&mdash;I implore you to raise the minimum wage. \\n\\nNow, 2 years ago&mdash;let me try to balance the seesaw here&mdash;&mdash;2 years ago, as we reached across party lines to reach our first balanced budget, I asked that we meet our responsibility to the next generation by maintaining our fiscal discipline. Because we refused to stray from that path, we are doing something that would have seemed unimaginable 7 years ago. We are actually paying down the national debt. Now, if we stay on this path, we can pay down the debt entirely in just 13 years now and make America debt-free for the first time since Andrew Jackson was President in 1835. \\n\\nIn 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you\\'ll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom. He\\'s here with us tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you. \\n\\nBeyond paying off the debt, we must ensure that the benefits of debt reduction go to preserving two of the most important guarantees we make to every American, Social Security and Medicare. Tonight I ask you to work with me to make a bipartisan downpayment on Social Security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security Trust Fund so that it will be strong and sound for the next 50 years. \\n\\nBut this is just the start of our journey. We must also take the right steps toward reaching our great goals. First and foremost, we need a 21st century revolution in education, guided by our faith that every single child can learn. Because education is more important than ever, more than ever the key to our children\\'s future, we must make sure all our children have that key. That means quality preschool and afterschool, the best trained teachers in the classroom, and college opportunities for all our children. \\n\\nFor 7 years now, we\\'ve worked hard to improve our schools, with opportunity and responsibility, investing more but demanding more in turn. Reading, math, college entrance scores are up. Some of the most impressive gains are in schools in very poor neighborhoods. \\n\\nBut all successful schools have followed the same proven formula: higher standards, more accountability, and extra help so children who need it can get it to reach those standards. I have sent Congress a reform plan based on that formula. It holds States and school districts accountable for progress and rewards them for results. Each year, our National Government invests more than $15 billion in our schools. It is time to support what works and stop supporting what doesn\\'t. \\n\\nNow, as we demand more from our schools, we should also invest more in our schools. Let\\'s double our investment to help States and districts turn around their worst performing schools or shut them down. Let\\'s double our investments in after-school and summer school programs, which boost achievement and keep people off the streets and out of trouble. If we do this, we can give every single child in every failing school in America&mdash;everyone&mdash;the chance to meet high standards. \\n\\nSince 1993, we\\'ve nearly doubled our investment in Head Start and improved its quality. Tonight I ask you for another $1 billion for Head Start, the largest increase in the history of the program. \\n\\nWe know that children learn best in smaller classes with good teachers. For 2 years in a row, Congress has supported my plan to hire 100,000 new qualified teachers to lower class size in the early grades. I thank you for that, and I ask you to make it 3 in a row. And to make sure all teachers know the subjects they teach, tonight I propose a new teacher quality initiative, to recruit more talented people into the classroom, reward good teachers for staying there, and give all teachers the training they need. \\n\\nWe know charter schools provide real public school choice. When I became President, there was just one independent public charter school in all America. Today, thanks to you, there are 1,700. I ask you now to help us meet our goal of 3,000 charter schools by next year. \\n\\nWe know we must connect all our classrooms to the Internet, and we\\'re getting there. In 1994, only 3 percent of our classrooms were connected. Today, with the help of the Vice President\\'s E-rate program, more than half of them are, and 90 percent of our schools have at least one Internet connection. But we cannot finish the job when a third of all our schools are in serious disrepair. Many of them have walls and wires so old, they\\'re too old for the Internet. So tonight I propose to help 5,000 schools a year make immediate and urgent repairs and, again, to help build or modernize 6,000 more, to get students out of trailers and into high-tech classrooms. \\n\\nI ask all of you to help me double our bipartisan GEAR UP program, which provides mentors for disadvantaged young people. If we double it, we can provide mentors for 1.4 million of them. Let\\'s also offer these kids from disadvantaged backgrounds the same chance to take the same college test-prep courses wealthier students use to boost their test scores. \\n\\nTo make the American dream achievable for all, we must make college affordable for all. For 7 years, on a bipartisan basis, we have taken action toward that goal: larger Pell grants, more affordable student loans, education IRA\\'s, and our HOPE scholarships, which have already benefited 5 million young people. \\n\\nNow, 67 percent of high school graduates are going on to college. That\\'s up 10 percent since 1993. Yet millions of families still strain to pay college tuition. They need help. So I propose a landmark $30 billion college opportunity tax cut, a middle class tax deduction for up to $10,000 in college tuition costs. The previous actions of this Congress have already made 2 years of college affordable for all. It\\'s time make 4 years of college affordable for all. If we take all these steps, we\\'ll move a long way toward making sure every child starts school ready to learn and graduates ready to succeed. \\n\\nWe also need a 21st century revolution to reward work and strengthen families by giving every parent the tools to succeed at work and at the most important work of all, raising children. That means making sure every family has health care and the support to care for aging parents, the tools to bring their children up right, and that no child grows up in poverty. \\n\\nFrom my first days as President, we\\'ve worked to give families better access to better health care. In 1997, we passed the Children\\'s Health Insurance Program&mdash;CHIP&mdash;so that workers who don\\'t have coverage through their employers at least can get it for their children. So far, we\\'ve enrolled 2 million children. We\\'re well on our way to our goal of 5 million. \\n\\nBut there are still more than 40 million of our fellow Americans without health insurance, more than there were in 1993. Tonight I propose that we follow Vice President Gore\\'s suggestion to make low income parents eligible for the insurance that covers their children. Together with our children\\'s initiative&mdash;think of this&mdash;together with our children\\'s initiative, this action would enable us to cover nearly a quarter of all the uninsured people in America. \\n\\nAgain, I want to ask you to let people between the ages of 55 and 65, the fastest growing group of uninsured, buy into Medicare. And this year I propose to give them a tax credit to make that choice an affordable one. I hope you will support that, as well. \\n\\nWhen the baby boomers retire, Medicare will be faced with caring for twice as many of our citizens; yet, it is far from ready to do so. My generation must not ask our children\\'s generation to shoulder our burden. We simply must act now to strengthen and modernize Medicare. \\n\\nMy budget includes a comprehensive plan to reform Medicare, to make it more efficient and more competitive. And it dedicates nearly $400 billion of our budget surplus to keep Medicare solvent past 2025. And at long last, it also provides funds to give every senior a voluntary choice of affordable coverage for prescription drugs. \\n\\nLifesaving drugs are an indispensable part of modern medicine. No one creating a Medicare program today would even think of excluding coverage for prescription drugs. Yet more than three in five of our seniors now lack dependable drug coverage which can lengthen and enrich their lives. Millions of older Americans, who need prescription drugs the most, pay the highest prices for them. In good conscience, we cannot let another year pass without extending to all our seniors this lifeline of affordable prescription drugs. \\n\\nRecord numbers of Americans are providing for aging or ailing loved ones at home. It\\'s a loving but a difficult and often very expensive choice. Last year, I proposed a $1,000 tax credit for long-term care. Frankly, it wasn\\'t enough. This year, let\\'s triple it to $3,000. But this year, let\\'s pass it. \\n\\nWe also have to make needed investments to expand access to mental health care. I want to take a moment to thank the person who led our first White House Conference on Mental Health last year and who for 7 years has led all our efforts to break down the barriers to decent treatment of people with mental illness. Thank you, Tipper Gore. \\n\\nTaken together, these proposals would mark the largest investment in health care in the 35 years since Medicare was created&mdash;the largest investment in 35 years. That would be a big step toward assuring quality health care for all Americans, young and old. And I ask you to embrace them and pass them. \\n\\nWe must also make investments that reward work and support families. Nothing does that better than the earned-income tax credit, the EITC. The \"E\" in the EITC is about earning, working, taking responsibility, and being rewarded for it. In my very first address to you, I asked Congress to greatly expand this credit, and you did. As a result, in 1998 alone, the EITC helped more than 4.3 million Americans work their way out of poverty toward the middle class. That\\'s double the number in 1993. \\n\\nTonight I propose another major expansion of the EITC: to reduce the marriage penalty, to make sure it rewards marriage as it rewards work, and also to expand the tax credit for families that have more than two children. It punishes people with more than two children today. Our proposal would allow families with three or more children to get up to $1,100 more in tax relief. These are working families; their children should not be in poverty. \\n\\nWe also can\\'t reward work and family unless men and women get equal pay for equal work. Today the female unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 46 years. Yet, women still only earn about 75 cents for every dollar men earn. We must do better, by providing the resources to enforce present equal pay laws, training more women for high-paying, high-tech jobs, and passing the \"Paycheck Fairness Act.\" \\n\\nMany working parents spend up to a quarter&mdash;a quarter&mdash;of their income on child care. Last year, we helped parents provide child care for about 2 million children. My child care initiative before you now, along with funds already secured in welfare reform, would make child care better, safer, and more affordable for another 400,000 children. I ask you to pass that. They need it out there. \\n\\nFor hard-pressed middle income families, we should also expand the child care tax credit. And I believe strongly we should take the next big step and make that tax credit refundable for low income families. For people making under $30,000 a year, that could mean up to $2,400 for child care costs. You know, we all say we\\'re pro-work and pro-family. Passing this proposal would prove it. \\n\\nTen of millions of Americans live from paycheck to paycheck. As hard as they work, they still don\\'t have the opportunity to save. Too few can make use of IRA\\'s and 401k plans. We should do more to help all working families save and accumulate wealth. That\\'s the idea behind the Individual Development Accounts, the IDA\\'s. I ask you to take that idea to a new level, with new retirement savings accounts that enable every low and moderate income family in America to save for retirement, a first home, a medical emergency, or a college education. I propose to match their contributions, however small, dollar for dollar, every year they save. And I propose to give a major new tax credit to any small business that will provide a meaningful pension to its workers. Those people ought to have retirement as well as the rest of us. \\n\\nNearly one in three American children grows up without a father. These children are 5 times more likely to live in poverty than children with both parents at home. Clearly, demanding and supporting responsible fatherhood is critical to lifting all our children out of poverty. We\\'ve doubled child support collections since 1992. And I\\'m proposing to you tough new measures to hold still more fathers responsible. \\n\\nBut we should recognize that a lot of fathers want to do right by their children but need help to do it. Carlos Rosas of St. Paul, Minnesota, wanted to do right by his son, and he got the help to do it. Now he\\'s got a good job, and he supports his little boy. My budget will help 40,000 more fathers make the same choices Carlos Rosas did. I thank him for being here tonight. Stand up, Carlos.  Thank you. \\n\\nIf there is any single issue on which we should be able to reach across party lines, it is in our common commitment to reward work and strengthen families. Just remember what we did last year. We came together to help people with disabilities keep their health insurance when they go to work. And I thank you for that. Thanks to overwhelming bipartisan support from this Congress, we have improved foster care. We\\'ve helped those young people who leave it when they turn 18, and we have dramatically increased the number of foster care children going into adoptive homes. I thank all of you for all of that. \\n\\nOf course, I am forever grateful to the person who has led our efforts from the beginning and who\\'s worked so tirelessly for children and families for 30 years now, my wife, Hillary, and I thank her. \\n\\nIf we take the steps just discussed, we can go a long, long way toward empowering parents to succeed at home and at work and ensuring that no child is raised in poverty. We can make these vital investments in health care, education, support for working families, and still offer tax cuts to help pay for college, for retirement, to care for aging parents, to reduce the marriage penalty. We can do these things without forsaking the path of fiscal discipline that got us to this point here tonight. Indeed, we must make these investments and these tax cuts in the context of a balanced budget that strengthens and extends the life of Social Security and Medicare and pays down the national debt. \\n\\nCrime in America has dropped for the past 7 years&mdash;that\\'s the longest decline on record&mdash; thanks to a national consensus we helped to forge on community police, sensible gun safety laws, and effective prevention. But nobody, nobody here, nobody in America believes we\\'re safe enough. So again, I ask you to set a higher goal. Let\\'s make this country the safest big country in the world. \\n\\nLast fall, Congress supported my plan to hire, in addition to the 100,000 community police we\\'ve already funded, 50,000 more, concentrated in high-crime neighborhoods. I ask your continued support for that. \\n\\nSoon after the Columbine tragedy, Congress considered commonsense gun legislation, to require Brady background checks at the gun shows, child safety locks for new handguns, and a ban on the importation of large capacity ammunition clips. With courage and a tie-breaking vote by the Vice President&mdash;&mdash;the Senate faced down the gun lobby, stood up for the American people, and passed this legislation. But the House failed to follow suit. \\n\\nNow, we have all seen what happens when guns fall into the wrong hands. Daniel Mauser was only 15 years old when he was gunned down at Columbine. He was an amazing kid, a straight-A student, a good skier. Like all parents who lose their children, his father, Tom, has borne unimaginable grief. Somehow he has found the strength to honor his son by transforming his grief into action. Earlier this month, he took a leave of absence from his job to fight for tougher gun safety laws. I pray that his courage and wisdom will at long last move this Congress to make commonsense gun legislation the very next order of business. Tom Mauser, stand up. We thank you for being here tonight. Tom. Thank you, Tom.  \\n\\nWe must strengthen our gun laws and enforce those already on the books better. Federal gun crime prosecutions are up 16 percent since I took office. But we must do more. I propose to hire more Federal and local gun prosecutors and more ATF agents to crack down on illegal gun traffickers and bad-apple dealers. And we must give them the enforcement tools that they need, tools to trace every gun and every bullet used in every gun crime in the United States. I ask you to help us do that. \\n\\nEvery State in this country already requires hunters and automobile drivers to have a license. I think they ought to do the same thing for handgun purchases. Now, specifically, I propose a plan to ensure that all new handgun buyers must first have a photo license from their State showing they passed the Brady background check and a gun safety course, before they get the gun. I hope you\\'ll help me pass that in this Congress. \\n\\nListen to this&mdash;listen to this. The accidental gun rate&mdash;the accidental gun death rate of children under 15 in the United States is 9 times higher than in the other 25 industrialized countries combined. Now, technologies now exist that could lead to guns that can only be fired by the adults who own them. I ask Congress to fund research into smart gun technology to save these children\\'s lives. I ask responsible leaders in the gun industry to work with us on smart guns and other steps to keep guns out of the wrong hands, to keep our children safe. \\n\\nYou know, every parent I know worries about the impact of violence in the media on their children. I want to begin by thanking the entertainment industry for accepting my challenge to put voluntary ratings on TV programs and video and Internet games. But frankly, the ratings are too numerous, diverse, and confusing to be really useful to parents. So tonight I ask the industry to accept the First Lady\\'s challenge to develop a single voluntary rating system for all children\\'s entertainment that is easier for parents to understand and enforce. \\n\\nThe steps I outline will take us well on our way to making America the safest big country in the world. \\n\\nNow, to keep our historic economic expansion going, the subject of a lot of discussion in this community and others, I believe we need a 21st century revolution to open new markets, start new businesses, hire new workers right here in America, in our inner cities, poor rural areas, and Native American reservations. \\n\\nOur Nation\\'s prosperity hasn\\'t yet reached these places. Over the last 6 months, I\\'ve traveled to a lot of them, joined by many of you and many far-sighted business people, to shine a spotlight on the enormous potential in communities from Appalachia to the Mississippi Delta, from Watts to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Everywhere I go, I meet talented people eager for opportunity and able to work. Tonight I ask you, let\\'s put them to work. For business, it\\'s the smart thing to do. For America, it\\'s the right thing to do. And let me ask you something: If we don\\'t do this now, when in the wide world will we ever get around to it? \\n\\nSo I ask Congress to give businesses the same incentives to invest in America\\'s new markets they now have to invest in markets overseas. Tonight I propose a large new markets tax credit and other incentives to spur $22 billion in private-sector capital to create new businesses and new investments in our inner cities and rural areas. Because empowerment zones have been creating these opportunities for 5 years now, I also ask you to increase incentives to invest in them and to create more of them. \\n\\nAnd let me say to all of you again what I have tried to say at every turn: This is not a Democratic or a Republican issue. Giving people a chance to live their dreams is an American issue. \\n\\nMr. Speaker, it was a powerful moment last November when you joined Reverend Jesse Jackson and me in your home State of Illinois and committed to working toward our common goal by combining the best ideas from both sides of the aisle. I want to thank you again and to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with you. This is a worthy joint endeavor. Thank you. \\n\\nI also ask you to make special efforts to address the areas of our Nation with the highest rates of poverty, our Native American reservations and the Mississippi Delta. My budget includes a $110 million initiative to promote economic development in the Delta and a billion dollars to increase economic opportunity, health care, education, and law enforcement for our Native American communities. We should begin this new century by honoring our historic responsibility to empower the first Americans. And I want to thank tonight the leaders and the members from both parties who\\'ve expressed to me an interest in working with us on these efforts. They are profoundly important. \\n\\nThere\\'s another part of our American community in trouble tonight, our family farmers. When I signed the farm bill in 1996, I said there was great danger it would work well in good times but not in bad. Well, droughts, floods, and historically low prices have made these times very bad for the farmers. We must work together to strengthen the farm safety net, invest in land conservation, and create some new markets for them by expanding our programs for bio-based fuels and products. Please, they need help. Let\\'s do it together. \\n\\nOpportunity for all requires something else today, having access to a computer and knowing how to use it. That means we must close the digital divide between those who\\'ve got the tools and those who don\\'t. Connecting classrooms and libraries to the Internet is crucial, but it\\'s just a start. My budget ensures that all new teachers are trained to teach 21st century skills, and it creates technology centers in 1,000 communities to serve adults. This spring, I\\'ll invite high-tech leaders to join me on another new markets tour, to close the digital divide and open opportunity for our people. I want to thank the high-tech companies that already are doing so much in this area. I hope the new tax incentives I have proposed will get all the rest of them to join us. This is a national crusade. We have got to do this and do it quickly. \\n\\nNow, again I say to you, these are steps, but step by step, we can go a long way toward our goal of bringing opportunity to every community. \\n\\nTo realize the full possibilities of this economy, we must reach beyond our own borders to shape the revolution that is tearing down barriers and building new networks among nations and individuals and economies and cultures: globalization. It\\'s the central reality of our time. \\n\\nOf course, change this profound is both liberating and threatening to people. But there\\'s no turning back. And our open, creative society stands to benefit more than any other if we understand and act on the realities of interdependence. We have to be at the center of every vital global network, as a good neighbor and a good partner. We have to recognize that we cannot build our future without helping others to build theirs. \\n\\nThe first thing we have got to do is to forge a new consensus on trade. Now, those of us who believe passionately in the power of open trade, we have to ensure that it lifts both our living standards and our values, never tolerating abusive child labor or a race to the bottom in the environment and worker protection. But others must recognize that open markets and rule-based trade are the best engines we know of for raising living standards, reducing global poverty and environmental destruction, and assuring the free flow of ideas. \\n\\nI believe, as strongly tonight as I did the first day I got here, the only direction forward for America on trade&mdash;the only direction for America on trade is to keep going forward. I ask you to help me forge that consensus. We have to make developing economies our partners in prosperity. That\\'s why I would like to ask you again to finalize our groundbreaking African and Caribbean Basin trade initiatives. \\n\\nBut globalization is about more than economics. Our purpose must be to bring together the world around freedom and democracy and peace and to oppose those who would tear it apart. Here are the fundamental challenges I believe America must meet to shape the 21st century world. \\n\\nFirst, we must continue to encourage our former adversaries, Russia and China, to emerge as stable, prosperous, democratic nations. Both are being held back today from reaching their full potential: Russia by the legacy of communism, an economy in turmoil, a cruel and self-defeating war in Chechnya; China by the illusion that it can buy stability at the expense of freedom. \\n\\nBut think how much has changed in the past decade: 5,000 former Soviet nuclear weapons taken out of commission; Russian soldiers actually serving with ours in the Balkans; Russian people electing their leaders for the first time in 1,000 years; and in China, an economy more open to the world than ever before. \\n\\nOf course, no one, not a single person in this Chamber tonight can know for sure what direction these great nations will take. But we do know for sure that we can choose what we do. And we should do everything in our power to increase the chance that they will choose wisely, to be constructive members of our global community. \\n\\nThat\\'s why we should support those Russians who are struggling for a democratic, prosperous future; continue to reduce both our nuclear arsenals; and help Russia to safeguard weapons and materials that remain. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s why I believe Congress should support the agreement we negotiated to bring China into the WTO, by passing permanent normal trade relations with China as soon as possible this year. I think you ought to do it for two reasons: First of all, our markets are already open to China; this agreement will open China\\'s markets to us. And second, it will plainly advance the cause of peace in Asia and promote the cause of change in China. No, we don\\'t know where it\\'s going. All we can do is decide what we\\'re going to do. But when all is said and done, we need to know we did everything we possibly could to maximize the chance that China will choose the right future. \\n\\nA second challenge we\\'ve got is to protect our own security from conflicts that pose the risk of wider war and threaten our common humanity. We can\\'t prevent every conflict or stop every outrage. But where our interests are at stake and we can make a difference, we should be, and we must be, peacemakers. \\n\\nWe should be proud of our role in bringing the Middle East closer to a lasting peace, building peace in Northern Ireland, working for peace in East Timor and Africa, promoting reconciliation between Greece and Turkey and in Cyprus, working to defuse these crises between India and Pakistan, in defending human rights and religious freedom. And we should be proud of the men and women of our Armed Forces and those of our allies who stopped the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, enabling a million people to return to their homes. \\n\\nWhen Slobodan Milosevic unleashed his terror on Kosovo, Captain John Cherrey was one of the brave airmen who turned the tide. And when another American plane was shot down over Serbia, he flew into the teeth of enemy air defenses to bring his fellow pilot home. Thanks to our Armed Forces\\' skill and bravery, we prevailed in Kosovo without losing a single American in combat. I want to introduce Captain Cherrey to you. We honor Captain Cherrey, and we promise you, Captain, we\\'ll finish the job you began. Stand up so we can see you.  \\n\\nA third challenge we have is to keep this inexorable march of technology from giving terrorists and potentially hostile nations the means to undermine our defenses. Keep in mind, the same technological advances that have shrunk cell phones to fit in the palms of our hands can also make weapons of terror easier to conceal and easier to use. \\n\\nWe must meet this threat by making effective agreements to restrain nuclear and missile programs in North Korea, curbing the flow of lethal technology to Iran, preventing Iraq from threatening its neighbors, increasing our preparedness against chemical and biological attack, protecting our vital computer systems from hackers and criminals, and developing a system to defend against new missile threats, while working to preserve our ABM missile treaty with Russia. We must do all these things. \\n\\nI predict to you, when most of us are long gone but some time in the next 10 to 20 years, the major security threat this country will face will come from the enemies of the nation-state, the narcotraffickers and the terrorists and the organized criminals who will be organized together, working together, with increasing access to ever more sophisticated chemical and biological weapons. And I want to thank the Pentagon and others for doing what they\\'re doing right now to try to help protect us and plan for that, so that our defenses will be strong. I ask for your support to ensure they can succeed. \\n\\nI also want to ask you for a constructive bipartisan dialog this year to work to build a consensus which I hope will eventually lead to the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. \\n\\nI hope we can also have a constructive effort to meet the challenge that is presented to our planet by the huge gulf between rich and poor. We cannot accept a world in which part of humanity lives on the cutting edge of a new economy and the rest live on the bare edge of survival. I think we have to do our part to change that with expanded trade, expanded aid, and the expansion of freedom. \\n\\nThis is interesting: From Nigeria to Indonesia, more people got the right to choose their leaders in 1999 than in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell. We\\'ve got to stand by these democracies, including and especially tonight Colombia, which is fighting narcotraffickers, for its own people\\'s lives and our children\\'s lives. I have proposed a strong 2-year package to help Colombia win this fight. I want to thank the leaders in both parties in both Houses for listening to me and the President of Colombia about it. We have got to pass this. I want to ask your help. A lot is riding on it. And it\\'s so important for the long-term stability of our country and for what happens in Latin America. \\n\\nI also want you to know I\\'m going to send you new legislation to go after what these drug barons value the most, their money. And I hope you\\'ll pass that as well. \\n\\nIn a world where over a billion people live on less than a dollar a day, we also have got to do our part in the global endeavor to reduce the debts of the poorest countries, so they can invest in education, health care, and economic growth. That\\'s what the Pope and other religious leaders have urged us to do. And last year, Congress made a downpayment on America\\'s share. I ask you to continue that. I thank you for what you did and ask you to stay the course. \\n\\nI also want to say that America must help more nations to break the bonds of disease. Last year in Africa, 10 times as many people died from AIDS as were killed in wars&mdash;10 times. The budget I give you invests $150 million more in the fight against this and other infectious killers. And today I propose a tax credit to speed the development of vaccines for diseases like malaria, TB, and AIDS. I ask the private sector and our partners around the world to join us in embracing this cause. We can save millions of lives together, and we ought to do it. \\n\\nI also want to mention our final challenge, which, as always, is the most important. I ask you to pass a national security budget that keeps our military the best trained and best equipped in the world, with heightened readiness and 21st century weapons, which raises salaries for our service men and women, which protects our veterans, which fully funds the diplomacy that keeps our soldiers out of war, which makes good on our commitment to our U.N. dues and arrears. I ask you to pass this budget. \\n\\nI also want to say something, if I might, very personal tonight. The American people watching us at home, with the help of all the commentators, can tell, from who stands and who sits and who claps and who doesn\\'t, that there\\'s still modest differences of opinion in this room.  But I want to thank you for something, every one of you. I want to thank you for the extraordinary support you have given, Republicans and Democrats alike, to our men and women in uniform. I thank you for that. \\n\\nI also want to thank, especially, two people. First, I want to thank our Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen, for symbolizing our bipartisan commitment to national security. Thank you, sir. Even more, I want to thank his wife, Janet, who, more than any other American citizen, has tirelessly traveled this world to show the support we all feel for our troops. Thank you, Janet Cohen. I appreciate that. Thank you. \\n\\nThese are the challenges we have to meet so that we can lead the world toward peace and freedom in an era of globalization. \\n\\nI want to tell you that I am very grateful for many things as President. But one of the things I\\'m grateful for is the opportunity that the Vice President and I have had to finally put to rest the bogus idea that you cannot grow the economy and protect the environment at the same time. \\n\\nAs our economy has grown, we\\'ve rid more than 500 neighborhoods of toxic waste, ensured cleaner air and water for millions of people. In the past 3 months alone, we\\'ve helped preserve 40 million acres of roadless lands in the national forests, created three new national monuments. \\n\\nBut as our communities grow, our commitment to conservation must continue to grow. Tonight I propose creating a permanent conservation fund, to restore wildlife, protect coastlines, save natural treasures, from the California redwoods to the Florida Everglades. This lands legacy endowment would represent by far the most enduring investment in land preservation ever proposed in this House. I hope we can get together with all the people with different ideas and do this. This is a gift we should give to our children and our grandchildren for all time, across party lines. We can make an agreement to do this. \\n\\nLast year the Vice President launched a new effort to make communities more liberal&mdash;livable&mdash;&mdash;liberal, I know.  Wait a minute, I\\'ve got a punchline now. That\\'s this year\\'s agenda; last year was livable, right?  That\\'s what Senator Lott is going to say in the commentary afterwards&mdash;&mdash;to make our communities more livable. This is big business. This is a big issue. What does that mean? You ask anybody that lives in an unlivable community, and they\\'ll tell you. They want their kids to grow up next to parks, not parking lots; the parents don\\'t have to spend all their time stalled in traffic when they could be home with their children. \\n\\nTonight I ask you to support new funding for the following things, to make American communities more liberal&mdash;livable.  I\\'ve done pretty well with this speech, but I can\\'t say that. \\n\\nOne, I want you to help us to do three things. We need more funding for advanced transit systems. We need more funding for saving open spaces in places of heavy development. And we need more funding&mdash;this ought to have bipartisan appeal&mdash;we need more funding for helping major cities around the Great Lakes protect their waterways and enhance their quality of life. We need these things, and I want you to help us. \\n\\nThe greatest environmental challenge of the new century is global warming. The scientists tell us the 1990\\'s were the hottest decade of the entire millennium. If we fail to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, deadly heat waves and droughts will become more frequent, coastal areas will flood, and economies will be disrupted. That is going to happen, unless we act. \\n\\nMany people in the United States, some people in this Chamber, and lots of folks around the world still believe you cannot cut greenhouse gas emissions without slowing economic growth. In the industrial age, that may well have been true. But in this digital economy, it is not true anymore. New technologies make it possible to cut harmful emissions and provide even more growth. \\n\\nFor example, just last week, automakers unveiled cars that get 70 to 80 miles a gallon, the fruits of a unique research partnership between Government and industry. And before you know it, efficient production of bio-fuels will give us the equivalent of hundreds of miles from a gallon of gasoline. \\n\\nTo speed innovation in these kind of technologies, I think we should give a major tax incentive to business for the production of clean energy and to families for buying energy-saving homes and appliances and the next generation of superefficient cars when they hit the showroom floor. I also ask the auto industry to use the available technologies to make all new cars more fuel-efficient right away. \\n\\nAnd I ask this Congress to do something else. Please help us make more of our clean energy technology available to the developing world. That will create cleaner growth abroad and a lot more new jobs here in the United States of America. \\n\\nIn the new century, innovations in science and technology will be key not only to the health of the environment but to miraculous improvements in the quality of our lives and advances in the economy. Later this year, researchers will complete the first draft of the entire human genome, the very blueprint of life. It is important for all our fellow Americans to recognize that Federal tax dollars have funded much of this research and that this and other wise investments in science are leading to a revolution in our ability to detect, treat, and prevent disease. \\n\\nFor example, researchers have identified genes that cause Parkinson\\'s, diabetes, and certain kinds of cancer. They are designing precision therapies that will block the harmful effect of these genes for good. Researchers already are using this new technique to target and destroy cells that cause breast cancer. Soon, we may be able to use it to prevent the onset of Alzheimer\\'s. Scientists are also working on an artificial retina to help many blind people to see and&mdash;listen to this&mdash;microchips that would actually directly stimulate damaged spinal cords in a way that could allow people now paralyzed to stand up and walk. \\n\\nThese kinds of innovations are also propelling our remarkable prosperity. Information technology only includes 8 percent of our employment but now accounts for a third of our economic growth along with jobs that pay, by the way, about 80 percent above the private sector average. Again, we ought to keep in mind, Government-funded research brought supercomputers, the Internet, and communications satellites into being. Soon researchers will bring us devices that can translate foreign languages as fast as you can talk, materials 10 times stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight, and&mdash; this is unbelievable to me&mdash;molecular computers the size of a teardrop with the power of today\\'s fastest supercomputers. \\n\\nTo accelerate the march of discovery across all these disciplines in science and technology, I ask you to support my recommendation of an unprecedented $3 billion in the 21st century research fund, the largest increase in civilian research in a generation. We owe it to our future. \\n\\nNow, these new breakthroughs have to be used in ways that reflect our values. First and foremost, we have to safeguard our citizens\\' privacy. Last year we proposed to protect every citizen\\'s medical record. This year we will finalize those rules. We\\'ve also taken the first steps to protect the privacy of bank and credit card records and other financial statements. Soon I will send legislation to you to finish that job. We must also act to prevent any genetic discrimination whatever by employers or insurers. I hope you will support that. \\n\\nThese steps will allow us to lead toward the far frontiers of science and technology. They will enhance our health, the environment, the economy in ways we can\\'t even imagine today. But we all know that at a time when science, technology, and the forces of globalization are bringing so many changes into all our lives, it\\'s more important than ever that we strengthen the bonds that root us in our local communities and in our national community. \\n\\nNo tie binds different people together like citizen service. There\\'s a new spirit of service in America, a movement we\\'ve tried to support with AmeriCorps, expanded Peace Corps, unprecedented new partnerships with businesses, foundations, community groups; partnerships, for example, like the one that enlisted 12,000 companies which have now moved 650,000 of our fellow citizens from welfare to work; partnerships to battle drug abuse, AIDS, teach young people to read, save America\\'s treasures, strengthen the arts, fight teen pregnancy, prevent violence among young people, promote racial healing. The American people are working together. \\n\\nBut we should do more to help Americans help each other. First, we should help faithbased organizations to do more to fight poverty and drug abuse and help people get back on the right track, with initiatives like Second Chance Homes that do so much to help unwed teen mothers. Second, we should support Americans who tithe and contribute to charities but don\\'t earn enough to claim a tax deduction for it. Tonight I propose new tax incentives that would allow low and middle income citizens who don\\'t itemize to get that deduction. It\\'s nothing but fair, and it will get more people to give. \\n\\nWe should do more to help new immigrants to fully participate in our community. That\\'s why I recommend spending more to teach them civics and English. And since everybody in our community counts, we\\'ve got to make sure everyone is counted in this year\\'s census. \\n\\nWithin 10 years&mdash;just 10 years&mdash;there will be no majority race in our largest State of California. In a little more than 50 years, there will be no majority race in America. In a more interconnected world, this diversity can be our greatest strength. Just look around this Chamber. Look around. We have Members in this Congress from virtually every racial, ethnic, and religious background. And I think you would agree that America is stronger because of it.  \\n\\nYou also have to agree that all those differences you just clapped for all too often spark hatred and division even here at home. Just in the last couple of years, we\\'ve seen a man dragged to death in Texas just because he was black. We saw a young man murdered in Wyoming just because he was gay. Last year we saw the shootings of African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Jewish children just because of who they were. This is not the American way, and we must draw the line. \\n\\nI ask you to draw that line by passing without delay the \"Hate Crimes Prevention Act\" and the \"Employment Non-Discrimination Act.\" And I ask you to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. \\n\\nFinally tonight, I propose the largest ever investment in our civil rights laws for enforcement, because no American should be subjected to discrimination in finding a home, getting a job, going to school, or securing a loan. Protections in law should be protections in fact. \\n\\nLast February, because I thought this was so important, I created the White House Office of One America to promote racial reconciliation. That\\'s what one of my personal heroes, Hank Aaron, has done all his life. From his days as our all-time home run king to his recent acts of healing, he has always brought people together. We should follow his example, and we\\'re honored to have him with us tonight. Stand up, Hank Aaron.  \\n\\nI just want to say one more thing about this, and I want every one of you to think about this the next time you get mad at one of your colleagues on the other side of the aisle. This fall, at the White House, Hillary had one of her millennium dinners, and we had this very distinguished scientist there, who is an expert in this whole work in the human genome. And he said that we are all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9 percent the same. \\n\\nNow, you may find that uncomfortable when you look around here.  But it is worth remembering. We can laugh about this, but you think about it. Modern science has confirmed what ancient faiths have always taught: the most important fact of life is our common humanity. Therefore, we should do more than just tolerate our diversity; we should honor it and celebrate it. \\n\\nMy fellow Americans, every time I prepare for the State of the Union, I approach it with hope and expectation and excitement for our Nation. But tonight is very special, because we stand on the mountaintop of a new millennium. Behind us we can look back and see the great expanse of American achievement, and before us we can see even greater, grander frontiers of possibility. We should, all of us, be filled with gratitude and humility for our present progress and prosperity. We should be filled with awe and joy at what lies over the horizon. And we should be filled with absolute determination to make the most of it. \\n\\nYou know, when the Framers finished crafting our Constitution in Philadelphia, Benjamin Franklin stood in Independence Hall, and he reflected on the carving of the Sun that was on the back of a chair he saw. The Sun was low on the horizon. So he said this&mdash;he said, \"I\\'ve often wondered whether that Sun was rising or setting. Today,\" Franklin said, \"I have the happiness to know it\\'s a rising Sun.\" Today, because each succeeding generation of Americans has kept the fire of freedom burning brightly, lighting those frontiers of possibility, we all still bask in the glow and the warmth of Mr. Franklin\\'s rising Sun. \\n\\nAfter 224 years, the American revolution continues. We remain a new nation. And as long as our dreams outweigh our memories, America will be forever young. That is our destiny. And this is our moment. \\n\\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless America.',\n",
       " u'\\n\\nMr. Speaker and Mr. President, distinguished Members of Congress, honored guests, and fellow citizens: \\n\\nThank you very much for that warm reception. You know, with the big buildup this address has had, I wanted to make sure it would be a big hit, but I couldn\\'t convince Barbara to deliver it for me.  \\n\\nI see the Speaker and the Vice President are laughing. They saw what I did in Japan, and they\\'re just happy they\\'re sitting behind me.  \\n\\nI mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they hold, and of some big problems and how, together, we can solve them and move our country forward as the undisputed leader of the age. \\n\\nWe gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history and in the history of man on Earth. For in the past 12 months, the world has known changes of almost Biblical proportions. And even now, months after the failed coup that doomed a failed system, I\\'m not sure we\\'ve absorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened. But communism died this year. \\n\\nEven as President, with the most fascinating possible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy managing progress and helping to lead change that I didn\\'t always show the joy that was in my heart. But the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the cold war. \\n\\nI mean to speak this evening of the changes that can take place in our country, now that we can stop making the sacrifices we had to make when we had an avowed enemy that was a superpower. Now we can look homeward even more and move to set right what needs to be set right. \\n\\nI will speak of those things. But let me tell you something I\\'ve been thinking these past few months. It\\'s a kind of rollcall of honor. For the cold war didn\\'t end; it was won. And I think of those who won it, in places like Korea and Vietnam. And some of them didn\\'t come back. Back then they were heroes, but this year they were victors. \\n\\nThe long rollcall, all the G.I. Joes and Janes, all the ones who fought faithfully for freedom, who hit the ground and sucked the dust and knew their share of horror. This may seem frivolous, and I don\\'t mean it so, but it\\'s moving to me how the world saw them. The world saw not only their special valor but their special style: their rambunctious, optimistic bravery, their do-or-die unity unhampered by class or race or region. What a group we\\'ve put forth, for generations now, from the ones who wrote \"Kilroy was here\" on the walls of the German stalags to those who left signs in the Iraqi desert that said, \"I saw Elvis.\" What a group of kids we\\'ve sent out into the world. \\n\\nAnd there\\'s another to be singled out, though it may seem inelegant, and I mean a mass of people called the American taxpayer. No one ever thinks to thank the people who pay a country\\'s bill or an alliance\\'s bill. But for half a century now, the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that were higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger than it would have been if imperial communism had never existed. But it did; doesn\\'t anymore. And here\\'s a fact I wouldn\\'t mind the world acknowledging: The American taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden and deserves a hunk of the glory. \\n\\nSo now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand down. No longer are they on \\'round-the-clock alert. Tomorrow our children will go to school and study history and how plants grow. And they won\\'t have, as my children did, air raid drills in which they crawl under their desks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war. My grandchildren don\\'t have to do that and won\\'t have the bad dreams children had once, in decades past. There are still threats. But the long, drawn-out dread is over. \\n\\nA year ago tonight, I spoke to you at a moment of high peril. American forces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm. And after 40 days in the desert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of America\\'s Armed Forces and our allies accomplished the goals that I declared and that you endorsed: We liberated Kuwait. Soon after, the Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously and comprehensively about peace, an historic first. And soon after that, at Christmas, the last American hostages came home. Our policies were vindicated. \\n\\nMuch good can come from the prudent use of power. And much good can come of this: A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one sole and preeminent power, the United States of America. And they regard this with no dread. For the world trusts us with power, and the world is right. They trust us to be fair and restrained. They trust us to be on the side of decency. They trust us to do what\\'s right. \\n\\nI use those words advisedly. A few days after the war began, I received a telegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the Gulf, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher. Even in her grief, she wanted me to know that some day when her children were old enough, she would tell them \"that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to do.\" And she said it all: It was the right thing to do. \\n\\nAnd we did it together. There were honest differences right here in this Chamber. But when the war began, you put partisanship aside, and we supported our troops. This is still a time for pride, but this is no time to boast. For problems face us, and we must stand together once again and solve them and not let our country down. \\n\\nTwo years ago, I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected the changes of the new era. But now, this year, with imperial communism gone, that process can be accelerated. Tonight I can tell you of dramatic changes in our strategic nuclear force. These are actions we are taking on our own because they are the right thing to do. After completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will shut down further production of the B - 2 bombers. We will cancel the small ICBM program. We will cease production of new warheads for our sea-based ballistic missiles. We will stop all new production of the Peacekeeper missile. And we will not purchase any more advanced cruise missiles. \\n\\nThis weekend I will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of the Russian Federation. I\\'ve informed President Yeltsin that if the Commonwealth, the former Soviet Union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead ballistic missiles, I will do the following: We will eliminate all Peacekeeper missiles. We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles by about one-third. And we will convert a substantial portion of our strategic bombers to primarily conventional use. President Yeltsin\\'s early response has been very positive, and I expect our talks at Camp David to be fruitful. \\n\\nI want you to know that for half a century, American Presidents have longed to make such decisions and say such words. But even in the midst of celebration, we must keep caution as a friend. For the world is still a dangerous place. Only the dead have seen the end of conflict. And though yesterday\\'s challenges are behind us, tomorrow\\'s are being born. \\n\\nThe Secretary of Defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I make them with confidence. But do not misunderstand me. The reductions I have approved will save us an additional $50 billion over the next 5 years. By 1997, we will have cut defense by 30 percent since I took office. These cuts are deep, and you must know my resolve: This deep, and no deeper. To do less would be insensible to progress, but to do more would be ignorant of history. We must not go back to the days of \"the hollow army.\" We cannot repeat the mistakes made twice in this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was purged as if the world were permanently safe. \\n\\nI remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding a program to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack. We must have this protection because too many people in too many countries have access to nuclear arms. And I urge you again to pass the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI. \\n\\nThere are those who say that now we can turn away from the world, that we have no special role, no special place. But we are the United States of America, the leader of the West that has become the leader of the world. And as long as I am President, I will continue to lead in support of freedom everywhere, not out of arrogance, not out of altruism, but for the safety and security of our children. This is a fact: Strength in the pursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no virtue. \\n\\nAnd now to our troubles at home. They\\'re not all economic; the primary problem is our economy. There are some good signs. Inflation, that thief, is down. And interest rates are down. But unemployment is too high, some industries are in trouble, and growth is not what it should be. Let me tell you right from the start and right from the heart, I know we\\'re in hard times. But I know something else: This will not stand. \\n\\nIn this Chamber, in this Chamber we can bring the same courage and sense of common purpose to the economy that we brought to Desert Storm. And we can defeat hard times together. I believe you\\'ll help. One reason is that you\\'re patriots, and you want the best for your country. And I believe that in your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done because it\\'s the right thing to do. \\n\\nThe power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea, that people will do great things if only you set them free. Well, we\\'re going to set the economy free. For if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us anything, it\\'s that if we can change the world we can change America. We must encourage investment. We must make it easier for people to invest money and create new products, new industries, and new jobs. We must clear away the obstacles to growth: high taxes, high regulation, redtape, and yes, wasteful Government spending. \\n\\nNone of this will happen with a snap of the fingers, but it will happen. And the test of a plan isn\\'t whether it\\'s called new or dazzling. The American people aren\\'t impressed by gimmicks; they\\'re smarter on this score than all of us in this room. The only test of a plan is: Is it sound, and will it work? \\n\\nWe must have a short-term plan to address our immediate needs and heat up the economy. And then we need a longer term plan to keep combustion going and to guarantee our place in the world economy. There are certain things that a President can do without Congress, and I\\'m going to do them. \\n\\nI have, this evening, asked major Cabinet departments and Federal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new Federal regulations that could hinder growth. In those 90 days, major departments and agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old and new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that will help growth. \\n\\nFurther, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible American workers and business men and women who\\'ve been forced to go without needed bank loans, the banking credit crunch must end. I won\\'t neglect my responsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but regulatory overkill must be stopped. And I\\'ve instructed our Government regulators to stop it. \\n\\nI have directed Cabinet departments and Federal agencies to speed up progrowth expenditures as quickly as possible. This should put an extra $10 billion into the economy in the next 6 months. And our new transportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and maintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being. And that means jobs building roads, jobs building bridges, and jobs building railways. \\n\\nAnd I have, this evening, directed the Secretary of the Treasury to change the Federal tax withholding tables. With this change, millions of Americans from whom the Government withholds more than necessary can now choose to have the Government withhold less from their paychecks. Something tells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one. This initiative could return about $25 billion back into our economy over the next 12 months, money people can use to help pay for clothing, college, or to get a new car. Finally, working with the Federal Reserve, we will continue to support monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down. \\n\\nNow, these are the things I can do. And now, Members of Congress, let me tell you what you can do for your country. You must pass the other elements of my plan to meet our economic needs. Everyone knows that investment spurs recovery. I am proposing this evening a change in the alternative minimum tax and the creation of a new 15-percent investment tax allowance. This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and bring people back to work. \\n\\nReal estate has led our economy out of almost all the tough times we\\'ve ever had. Once building starts, carpenters and plumbers work; people buy homes and take out mortgages. My plan would modify the passive loss rule for active real estate developers. And it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real estate. For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but who can\\'t quite afford it, my plan would allow first-time homebuyers to withdraw savings from IRA\\'s without penalty and provide a $5,000 tax credit for the first purchase of that home. \\n\\nAnd finally, my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to people who own a home, to everyone who has a business or a farm or a single investment. This time, at this hour, I cannot take no for an answer. You must cut the capital gains tax on the people of our country. Never has an issue been more demagogued by its opponents. But the demagogs are wrong. They are wrong, and they know it. Sixty percent of the people who benefit from lower capital gains have incomes under $50,000. A cut in the capital gains tax increases jobs and helps just about everyone in our country. And so, I\\'m asking you to cut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15.4 percent. \\n\\nI\\'ll tell you, those of you who say, \"Oh, no, someone who\\'s comfortable may benefit from that,\" you kind of remind me of the old definition of the Puritan who couldn\\'t sleep at night, worrying that somehow, someone somewhere was out having a good time.  The opponents of this measure and those who have authored various so-called soak-the-rich bills that are floating around this Chamber should be reminded of something: When they aim at the big guy, they usually hit the little guy. And maybe it\\'s time that stopped. \\n\\nThis, then, is my short-term plan. Your part, Members of Congress, requires enactment of these commonsense proposals that will have a strong effect on the economy without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax rates. \\n\\nWhile my plan is being passed and kicking in, we\\'ve got to care for those in trouble today. I have provided for up to $4.4 billion in my budget to extend Federal unemployment benefits. And I ask for congressional action right away. And I thank the committee.  Well, at last. \\n\\nLet\\'s be frank. Let\\'s be frank. Let me level with you. I know and you know that my plan is unveiled in a political season.  I know and you know that everything I propose will be viewed by some in merely partisan terms. But I ask you to know what is in my heart. And my aim is to increase our Nation\\'s good. I\\'m doing what I think is right, and I am proposing what I know will help. \\n\\nI pride myself that I\\'m a prudent man, and I believe that patience is a virtue. But I understand that politics is, for some, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then decry the lack of improvement.  But let me tell you: Far more important than my political future and far more important than yours is the well-being of our country. Members of this Chamber are practical people, and I know you won\\'t resent some practical advice. When people put their party\\'s fortunes, whatever the party, whatever side of this aisle, before the public good, they court defeat not only for their country but for themselves. And they will certainly deserve it. \\n\\nI submit my plan tomorrow, and I\\'m asking you to pass it by March 20th. And I ask the American people to let you know they want this action by March 20th. From the day after that, if it must be, the battle is joined. And you know, when principle is at stake I relish a good, fair fight. \\n\\nI said my plan has two parts, and it does. And it\\'s the second part that is the heart of the matter. For it\\'s not enough to get an immediate burst. We need long-term improvement in our economic position. We all know that the key to our economic future is to ensure that America continues as an economic leader of the world. We have that in our power. Here, then, is my long-term plan to guarantee our future. \\n\\nFirst, trade: We will work to break down the walls that stop world trade. We will work to open markets everywhere. And in our major trade negotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies that damage America\\'s farmers and workers. And we\\'ll get more good American jobs within our own hemisphere through the North American free trade agreement and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. \\n\\nBut changes are here, and more are coming. The workplace of the future will demand more highly skilled workers than ever, more people who are computer-literate, highly educated. We must be the world\\'s leader in education. And we must revolutionize America\\'s schools. My America 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal. My plan will give parents more choice, give teachers more flexibility, and help communities create new American schools. Thirty States across the Nation have established America 2000 programs. Hundreds of cities and towns have joined in. Now Congress must join this great movement: Pass my proposals for new American schools. \\n\\nThat was my second long-term proposal, and here\\'s my third: We must make commonsense investments that will help us compete, long-term, in the marketplace. We must encourage research and development. My plan is to make the R&D; tax credit permanent and to provide record levels of support, over $76 billion this year alone, for people who will explore the promise of emerging technologies. \\n\\nFourth, we must do something about crime and drugs. It is time for a major, renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. It saps our strength and hurts our faith in our society and in our future together. Surely a tired woman on her way to work at 6 in the morning on a subway deserves the right to get there safely. And surely it\\'s true that everyone who changes his or her life because of crime, from those afraid to go out at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for, surely these people have been denied a basic civil right. It is time to restore it. Congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill. It is tough on criminals and supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed halls for years now. Pass it. Help your country. \\n\\nFifth, I ask you tonight to fund our HOPE housing proposal and to pass my enterprise zone legislation which will get businesses into the inner city. We must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a home, getting a job, becoming a part of things. My plan would encourage real estate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage revenue bonds and low-income housing. And I ask tonight for record expenditures for the program that helps children born into want move into excellence, Head Start. \\n\\nStep six, we must reform our health care system. For this, too, bears on whether or not we can compete in the world. American health costs have been exploding. This year America will spend over $800 billion on health, and that is expected to grow to 1.6 trillion by the end of the decade. We simply cannot afford this. The cost of health care shows up not only in your family budget but in the price of everything we buy and everything we sell. When health coverage for a fellow on an assembly line costs thousands of dollars, the cost goes into the products he makes, and you pay the bill. \\n\\nWe must make a choice. Now, some pretend we can have it both ways. They call it \"play or pay,\" but that expensive approach is unstable. It will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs, and eventually a system under complete Government control. \\n\\nReally, there are only two options. And we can move toward a nationalized system, a system which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the Government to ration services arbitrarily. And what we\\'ll get is patients in long lines, indifferent service, and a huge new tax burden. Or we can reform our own private health care system, which still gives us, for all its flaws, the best quality health care in the world. \\n\\nWell, let\\'s build on our strengths. My plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving and increasing the idea of choice. We make basic health insurance affordable for all low-income people not now covered, and we do it by providing a health insurance tax credit of up to $3,750 for each low-income family. And the middle class gets help, too. And by reforming the health insurance market, my plan assures that Americans will have access to basic health insurance even if they change jobs or develop serious health problems. We must bring costs under control, preserve quality, preserve choice, and reduce the people\\'s nagging daily worry about health insurance. My plan, the details of which I\\'ll announce very shortly, does just that. \\n\\nSeventh, we must get the Federal deficit under control. We now have, in law, enforceable spending caps and a requirement that we pay for the programs we create. There are those in Congress who would ease that discipline now. But I cannot let them do it, and I won\\'t. \\n\\nMy plan would freeze all domestic discretionary budget authority, which means no more next year than this year. I will not tamper with Social Security, but I would put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending. And I would also freeze Federal domestic Government employment. And with the help of Congress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don\\'t deserve Federal funding. Some of them have noble titles, but none of them is indispensable. We can get rid of each and every one of them. \\n\\nYou know, it\\'s time we rediscovered a home truth the American people have never forgotten: This Government is too big and spends too much. And I call upon Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual ritual of filling the budget with pork barrel appropriations. Every year, the press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples: a Lawrence Welk museum, research grants for Belgian endive. We all know how these things get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help you say no. I know how to say it, and I know what I need to make it stick. Give me the same thing 43 Governors have, the line-item veto, and let me help you control spending. \\n\\nWe must put an end to unfinanced Federal Government mandates. These are the requirements Congress puts on our cities, counties, and States without supplying the money. If Congress passes a mandate, it should be forced to pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. After all, a mandate just increases someone else\\'s burden, and that means higher taxes at the State and local level. \\n\\nStep eight, Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still awaiting congressional action: bank reform, civil justice reform, tort reform, and my national energy strategy. \\n\\nAnd finally, we must strengthen the family because it is the family that has the greatest bearing on our future. When Barbara holds an AIDS baby in her arms and reads to children, she\\'s saying to every person in this country: Family matters. \\n\\nAnd I am announcing tonight a new Commission on America\\'s Urban Families. I\\'ve asked Missouri\\'s Governor John Ashcroft to be Chairman, former Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss to be Cochair. You know, I had mayors, the leading mayors from the League of Cities, in the other day at the White House, and they told me something striking. They said that every one of them, Republican or Democrat, agreed on one thing, that the major cause of the problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family. They asked for this Commission, and they were right to ask because it\\'s time to determine what we can do to keep families together, strong and sound. \\n\\nThere\\'s one thing we can do right away: Ease the burden of rearing a child. I ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per child for every family. For a family with four kids, that\\'s an increase of $2,000. This is a good start in the right direction, and it\\'s what we can afford. \\n\\nIt\\'s time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student loans. I am asking you to do just that. And I\\'m asking you to allow people to use money from their IRA\\'s to pay medical and education expenses, all without penalties. \\n\\nAnd I\\'m asking for more. Ask American parents what they dislike about how things are going in our country, and chances are good that pretty soon they\\'ll get to welfare. Americans are the most generous people on Earth. But we have to go back to the insight of Franklin Roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the welfare program, warned that it must not become \"a narcotic\" and a \"subtle destroyer\" of the spirit. Welfare was never meant to be a lifestyle. It was never meant to be a habit. It was never supposed to be passed from generation to generation like a legacy. It\\'s time to replace the assumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system. \\n\\nStates throughout the country are beginning to operate with new assumptions that when able-bodied people receive Government assistance, they have responsibilities to the taxpayer: A responsibility to seek work, education, or job training; a responsibility to get their lives in order; a responsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having children out of wedlock; and a responsibility to obey the law. We are going to help this movement. Often, State reform requires waiving certain Federal regulations. I will act to make that process easier and quicker for every State that asks for our help. \\n\\nI want to add, as we make these changes, we work together to improve this system, that our intention is not scapegoating or finger-pointing. If you read the papers and watch TV, you know there\\'s been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist comments, anti-Semitism, an increased sense of division. Really, this is not us. This is not who we are. And this is not acceptable. \\n\\nAnd so, you have my plan for America. And I\\'m asking for big things, but I believe in my heart you\\'ll do what\\'s right. \\n\\nYou know, it\\'s kind of an American tradition to show a certain skepticism toward our democratic institutions. I myself have sometimes thought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way through Congress.  You will deliberate, and you will discuss, and that is fine. But, my friends, the people cannot wait. They need help now. \\n\\nThere\\'s a mood among us. People are worried. There\\'s been talk of decline. Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired. And I thought: Really? You go tell Neil Armstrong standing on the moon. Tell the men and women who put him there. Tell the American farmer who feeds his country and the world. Tell the men and women of Desert Storm. \\n\\nMoods come and go, but greatness endures. Ours does. And maybe for a moment it\\'s good to remember what, in the dailiness of our lives, we forget: We are still and ever the freest nation on Earth, the kindest nation on Earth, the strongest nation on Earth. And we have always risen to the occasion. And we are going to lift this Nation out of hard times inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us had better step aside. Because I look at hard times, and I make this vow: This will not stand. \\n\\nAnd so, we move on together, a rising nation, the once and future miracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world. Thank you. God bless you, and God bless our beloved country. Thank you very, very much.']"
